  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Grain for Green (GfG) Program / Sloping Land Conversion Program / Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Grain for Green (GfG) Program, officially known as the Sloping Land Conversion Program or Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program, is a large-scale ecological restoration and poverty alleviation initiative in China. It provides poor rural households with direct subsidies—both grain and cash—when they convert their cropland on steep slopes to forest or grassland. The program is multi-component in the sense that it targets environmental improvement and poverty reduction, but it does not meet the definition of a 'graduation program' as understood in social protection literature: it does not deliver a sequence of cash and assets plus intensive training and coaching intended to 'graduate' ultra-poor households into sustainable livelihoods. There is no evidence from credible sources that participants receive productive assets (like livestock, equipment, or business capital) as part of the program. Compensation is provided through cash payments and grain subsidies to compensate for lost agricultural income, but not in the form of asset transfers. The program does facilitate economic diversification post-conversion—such as employment in cooperatives and local industries—but the core intervention is cash/grain compensation for land-use change, not asset distribution. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.fao.org/4/ae537e/ae537e0j.htm, http://www.cnfocus.com/swapping-grain-for-green-farmers-plant-their-way-out-of/, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5111936",
