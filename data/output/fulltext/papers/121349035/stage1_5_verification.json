It is not a graduation program in the BRAC sense (multi-component, time-limited, focused on the ultra-poor, with sequenced cash, assets, and coaching) but rather a broad, multi-pronged national strategy.[1][4][3] TPA emphasizes targeting support to individual poor households and implementing interventions such as new economic activities, relocation from uninhabitable areas, eco-compensation, education, and social assistance.[3] There is clear evidence that productive asset transfers—such as support for economic activities (e.g., livestock, crop production, or micro-enterprises)—are major components.[3][4] Some sources mention one-time financial or material support, but none confirm regular or substantial cash transfers or stipends as a systematic component, and support appears highly heterogeneous and not cash-transfer-based as seen in graduation models.[1][2] Thus, cash as a core component remains unclear, though incidental cash aid is not ruled out. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://regional.chinadaily.com.cn/Qiushi/2024-12/03/c_1049879.htm, https://sccei.fsi.stanford.edu/china-briefs/how-participation-chinas-poverty-alleviation-campaign-affected-firm-performance-and",
