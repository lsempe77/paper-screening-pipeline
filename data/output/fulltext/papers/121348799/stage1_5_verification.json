  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'County Poverty Alleviation Planning (CPAP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: There is no explicit reference to a 'County Poverty Alleviation Planning (CPAP)' program in the search results, nor clear evidence that a program of this exact name exists as a distinct, official entity in China's poverty strategy. However, China's poverty alleviation framework relies heavily on county-level planning, targeted support, and comprehensive development schemes, as documented in multiple sources[1][4][6]. These strategies are multi-component: they include cash transfers (subsidies), as indicated by the distribution of subsidies recorded per household[2], and also the provision of productive assets and technical training to promote industry and employment among the poor[5][3]. While this overall framework shares graduation program elements—targeted support, multi-component assistance, focus on ultra-poor households, and encouragement of economic self-sufficiency—no source explicitly labels it using the specialized 'graduation program' terminology seen in BRAC, IPA, or J-PAL literature, and there is no mention of a formal randomized control trial or standardized evaluation framework typical of global graduation programs. Thus, cash and assets components are clearly present, but whether the program is formally a 'graduation program' according to international definitions remains unclear. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: MEDIUM | Sources: https://theaseanpost.com/article/learning-chinas-poverty-alleviation-program, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://en.qstheory.cn/2021-04/30/c_617642.htm",
