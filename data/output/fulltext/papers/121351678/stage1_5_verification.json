  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'State-Owned Asset Management Companies (SOAMCs) and SASAC' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: State-Owned Asset Management Companies (SOAMCs) and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) are government institutions in China responsible for supervising, managing, and restructuring state-owned enterprises and assets. There is no evidence or credible reference that identifies SOAMCs or SASAC as direct implementers of graduation or multi-component poverty alleviation programs in the sense used by the BRAC or World Bank (i.e., targeted anti-poverty programs for the ultra poor involving sequenced cash transfers and productive assets). Instead, their roles are focused on macroeconomic, managerial and corporate governance tasks aimed at improving the efficiency and profitability of SOEs, not direct assistance to ultra-poor individuals or households. None of the search results or any reputable sources suggest these entities deliver cash transfers or productive asset packages to poor households for livelihood graduation. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/202206/21/content_WS62b18060c6d02e533532c757.html, https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/about/newsroom/349.html",
