  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Zambia Child Grant Programme (CGP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Zambia Child Grant Programme (CGP) is a government-administered social protection program that provides unconditional cash transfers to ultra-poor households with children under five years old[1][2][3][4]. The primary intervention is the direct provision of cash: households typically received between 55 and 70 Kwacha per month, with no reported conditions for receipt. Multiple evaluations and government documents describe the CGP solely as a cash transfer program and do not mention the direct provision of productive assets (such as livestock, equipment, or agricultural inputs)[1][2][3][4][5]. While one of the program’s stated objectives is to increase asset ownership (such as livestock), evaluation literature makes clear this is an indirect effect of cash transfers, not the result of a distinct asset transfer or livelihood support component[1][2][4]. Academic and evaluation sources examining the CGP’s impacts make explicit that it is not a 'graduation program'—the evidence suggests that while some positive impacts persist, most fade out rapidly once transfers end, and cash alone, without complementary productive asset or skills interventions, is insufficient to graduate ultra-poor households from poverty[4]. No source identifies the CGP as a graduation or multi-component program in the sense of BRAC, IPA, or J-PAL graduation models. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a089b240f0b652dd000370/a-as243e.pdf, https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/zambia/, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6711746/",
