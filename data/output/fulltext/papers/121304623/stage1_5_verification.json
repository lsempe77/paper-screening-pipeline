  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Bottom-up wheat seed technology transfer program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Based on the available evidence, the Bottom-up wheat seed technology transfer program in Bangladesh is a technology dissemination and agricultural extension initiative focused on improving access to higher-yield wheat seed varieties among smallholder, marginal, and landless farmers[1][2][3]. The program involves training farmers in seed production and facilitating community-level adoption of improved seed varieties (such as Shatabdi), which are then sold and disseminated for income generation. Farmers benefit from access to productive assets (high-yield seeds and sometimes equipment for processing or postharvest handling), and there is explicit mention of improvements in 'all five capital assets,' indicating a focus on asset accumulation—not graduation out of ultra-poverty typically seen in multi-component graduation programs[1]. There is no evidence of direct cash transfers or stipends as part of the program, and the primary support mechanism is the provision of technology and training rather than multi-component packages including cash. The intervention is not described as having a defined set of sequenced interventions typical of graduation programs; rather, the focus is on agricultural productivity through technology transfer. The sources directly reference the Bangladesh context, interventions, and outcomes, but do not link this initiative to major graduation frameworks like BRAC or similar programs. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08c2640f0b64974001022/Bangladeshfinalreport.pdf, https://www.fao.org/4/w8595t/w8595t07.htm, https://www.css.cornell.edu/FoodSystems/TA%20Annual%20Report%2002-03.pdf",
