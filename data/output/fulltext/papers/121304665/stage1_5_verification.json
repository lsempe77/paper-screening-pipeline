  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Northwest Area Foundation Programs' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Northwest Area Foundation is a philanthropic grantmaker that funds organizations working to reduce poverty and achieve social and economic justice in an eight-state region of the U.S.[1][3][4][5][6][7][8] There is no evidence it directly operates or funds a 'graduation' or multi-component anti-poverty program akin to the BRAC or CGAP-World Bank graduation model, which explicitly combines time-bound cash transfers, assets, livelihoods training, and coaching for extremely poor households. The Foundation provides grants to organizations focused on access to capital, enterprise development, financial inclusion, and technical assistance, as well as supporting CDFIs and other intermediaries; it does not implement direct cash transfer or productive asset distribution itself[1][2][3][4]. Grantee organizations such as Akiptan and Native360 Loan Fund provide affordable credit and capital to Native communities, but these are loans or business support services, not unconditional cash transfers or the direct provision of productive assets associated with graduation programs[2]. No reference in the latest available sources identifies any of the Foundation's own programs as providing cash stipends or tangible productive assets directly to individuals or households. The Foundation's support generally comes as grants to organizations, rather than direct anti-poverty interventions targeted at households. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://inrc.law.uiowa.edu/grants/northwest-area-foundation, https://www.nwaf.org/approach/priority-communities/, https://www.nwaf.org/about/",
