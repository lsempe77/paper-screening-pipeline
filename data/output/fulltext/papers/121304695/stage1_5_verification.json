  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar (Pronaf)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Pronaf is Brazil's principal program for supporting family farming, primarily through the provision of rural credit (microfinance) via concessional loans and favorable terms to small-scale and low-income family farmers[2][8]. These credit lines are designed to enable farmers to invest in productive assets, such as seeds, inputs, machinery, rural housing, and systems for various agricultural activities. While the program targets many participants listed in the Unified Registry for Federal Social Programs (Cadastro Único), including those in poverty or vulnerability[2], there is no direct evidence that Pronaf provides unconditional or conditional cash transfers or direct income stipends to beneficiaries. Instead, the support is in the form of subsidized loans for productive investments, which distinguishes it from graduation-style programs or multi-component ultra-poor interventions (such as BRAC or 'productive inclusion' graduation programs) that typically combine cash, productive assets, and intensive coaching[6]. Impact evaluations discuss Pronaf only as a credit-based intervention focused on productive investment[3][5][7], and official documentation refers to it as Brazil's microfinance program for agriculture[8]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://globalallianceagainsthungerandpoverty.org/country-example/brazil-program-for-strengthening-family-farming-pronaf/, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08a5ded915d622c0006d7/120106_ENV_AdaSemReg_BRIEF_3.pdf, https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-agricultural-and-applied-economics/article/does-access-to-rural-credit-help-decrease-income-inequality-in-brazil/8E8B2CB1488FF5A37DF8F24A74F33AB3",
