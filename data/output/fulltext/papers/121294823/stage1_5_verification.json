  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'National Poverty Counties (NPCs) Program / RNPCs Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Based on recent academic and policy literature, the 'National Poor Counties (NPCs) Program' is a large-scale area-based poverty alleviation initiative in China, targeting designated poor counties for concentrated investments[6][2][3]. It is not classified as a 'graduation program' in the sense popularized by BRAC and similar models (which involve a sequenced package of cash, assets, training, and social support for ultra-poor individuals, aiming for sustained graduation from poverty)[6]. Instead, the NPCs program uses a place-based strategy with multi-year status and grants. Multiple sources confirm the program delivered substantial financial transfers and policy support, with counties receiving 'large transfers'[2][6]. Specific evidence from World Bank and other evaluations indicates increases in net income for rural peasants and production capital investment[2][5]. Counties preferred productive investments, meaning the program did include a provision for productive assets (e.g., agricultural capital, infrastructure, production inputs)[2]. Components of the interventions included both direct cash transfers (to support consumption and basic needs) and productive asset provision, though implementation favored production-oriented spending over human capital. The underlying official name is 'National Poor Counties (NPCs) Program', not 'graduation' or 'ultra-poor' program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2024.2393451, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8129705/, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02631-3",
