  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'E-commerce to the countryside policy (Comprehensive Demonstration Counties for E-commerce in Rural Areas program)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The 'E-commerce to the countryside policy' or 'Comprehensive Demonstration Counties for E-commerce in Rural Areas program' refers to the Rural E-Commerce Comprehensive Demonstration (RECD) Program in China. This program aims to reduce the urban-rural income gap by fostering rural e-commerce development through infrastructure investments (such as logistics centers, service stations, delivery systems, and market upgrades) and capacity building (like entrepreneurship training and support for rural enterprises)[1][2][6]. There is no evidence of the program distributing cash transfers or stipends directly to individuals or households. Instead, its 'productive assets' component includes building and upgrading logistics infrastructure, retail and wholesale markets, cold storage, and delivery centers—resources that enable economic activity but are not handed out as direct asset grants to ultra-poor households as in graduation programs[1][2][6]. The program is not structured as a 'graduation' model (like BRAC or IPA's ultra-poor programs involving sequenced cash, asset transfer, and coaching for the extremely poor)[3]; rather, it supports rural households and enterprises via enabling public goods, entrepreneurship training, e-commerce competition, and talent development for income and employment impacts but without individualized productive asset grants or direct financial transfers. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://voxchina.org/show-3-428.html, https://en.people.cn/n3/2023/1204/c98649-20105458.html, https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/552791574361533437/pdf/E-commerce-Development-Experience-from-China.pdf",
