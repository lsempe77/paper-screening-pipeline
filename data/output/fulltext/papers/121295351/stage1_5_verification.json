Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) in Ethiopia is widely recognized as a multi-component poverty program with explicit graduation objectives. The PSNP provides regular cash or food transfers to support the poorest and most food-insecure households, which is described as the consumption support or cash component. Multiple sources affirm the cash transfer function of the program[3][9]. In addition, the 'graduation model' layered onto PSNP includes the provision of productive asset transfers—subsidized assets or lump-sum cash provided to enable household members to start or expand livelihoods[3][4]. Impact evaluations and program documents highlight that the PSNP aims not just to meet immediate basic needs but to enable self-reliance, with 'graduation' defined as a household no longer needing external transfers because it can meet food needs and withstand modest shocks, typically measured in part by productive asset accumulation[3][1]. The program's graduation pilots, supported by organizations such as BRAC and the Ford Foundation, explicitly incorporate this dual support (cash and assets) as part of the graduation approach[1][2]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.care.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spir_learning_brief-sustainability_of_psnp_household_graduation-final_0.pdf, https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/",
