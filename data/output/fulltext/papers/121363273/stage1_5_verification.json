  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: MGNREGA is not a graduation program per the standard definition used in poverty research: graduation programs (like BRAC's or IPA's models) are multi-component interventions for the ultra-poor which generally include asset transfers, cash stipends, coaching, and financial inclusion, specifically targeting sustainable exit from extreme poverty with lasting livelihood change[4][9]. MGNREGA is a wage employment guarantee scheme entitling rural households up to 100 days of paid manual work per year, based on self-selection, not household targeting for ultra-poor or intensive accompaniment[3][5][6]. The scheme provides a cash component in the form of wages for labor[2][5], and importantly, it funds local infrastructure development through participants' work, resulting in productive assets such as roads, ponds, check dams, irrigation facilities, and more, which are community assets—not individualized household transfers[2][3]. Several sources note MGNREGA's role in poverty reduction, income stability, and asset creation (community assets), but its structure and objectives differ from the graduation approach; it is primarily an employment guarantee program for poor and vulnerable rural households, not an integrated ultra-poor graduation program[3][5][1][6]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.giz.de/en/downloads/Working%20Paper%20-%20An%20Introduction%20to%20MGNREGA%20Innovations%20and%20their%20Potential%20for%20India-Africa%20Linkages.pdf, https://www.nilerd.ac.in/writereaddata/UploadFile/RaviKumarGuptaandVaibhavKantMishra.pdf, https://ihds.umd.edu/system/files/2021-03/MGNREGA%20Report%20Complete2015-08-08.pdf",
