  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Growth through Nutrition' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Growth through Nutrition in Ethiopia, also called the Growth through Nutrition Activity, was a large-scale multi-sector project focused on nutrition and WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) interventions, implemented by partners including USAID and Save the Children from 2016–2021. Authoritative documentation and Save the Children resources confirm it as a flagship nutrition and hygiene initiative, not as a 'graduation' or multi-component poverty alleviation program (as per the graduation model). The program primarily aimed at improving nutrition and reducing stunting through integrated interventions—sanitation, hygiene promotion, nutrition education, and health services. There is no credible evidence from official program descriptions or evaluations that Growth through Nutrition included direct cash transfers, stipends, nor the provision of productive assets (such as livestock, grants, or business start-up kits), which are core to graduation models. The true graduation interventions embedded within Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program—evaluated in recent literature—are distinct from Growth through Nutrition and operated separately, sometimes piloted by other development partners (e.g., IFPRI, World Vision, IPA, J-PAL). Studies referring to graduation models in Ethiopia mention nutrition-sensitive grants, productive asset transfers, and business coaching, but always in the context of explicitly labeled graduation programs, not the Growth through Nutrition Activity. Thus, Growth through Nutrition is not a graduation program and offered neither cash nor productive asset transfers. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/collection/growth-through-nutrition, https://www.usaid.gov/ethiopia/health/growth-through-nutrition, https://essp.ifpri.info/2025/10/29/scalable-nutrition-interventions-in-a-graduation-model-program-experimental-evidence-from-ethiopia/",
