  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'National Poverty Eradication Programme (NAPEP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: NAPEP was a Nigerian government program launched in 2001 for poverty reduction, primarily through vocational training, micro-credit support, and employment creation, particularly for youths[3]. Its programs included skill acquisition, microcredit, and youth employment schemes, but it is not described in authoritative sources as a 'graduation' or multi-component ultra-poor graduation program, which typically refers to the comprehensive and sequenced model pioneered by BRAC (including cash transfers, assets, mentoring, and coaching)[4]. NAPEP pre-dated this approach and focused on broader poverty reduction. There is reference in 2025 to fraudulent websites impersonating a 'revived' NAPEP claiming monthly cash transfers, but official sources and reporting clarify that NAPEP no longer exists as an active government platform and that current poverty reduction efforts are run under a different program (NASSCO/NASSP)[3]. There is no reliable evidence that NAPEP provided direct cash transfers or productive asset transfers in the targeted manner of a graduation program. Its primary modalities were training, micro-credit, and support services, not unconditional or sequenced cash/assets. Government alerts further stress that recent cash transfer claims under the NAPEP brand are fraudulent[3]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Poverty_Eradication_Programme, https://poverty-action.org/ultra-poor-graduation-approach",
