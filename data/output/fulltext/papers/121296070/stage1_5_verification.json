It provides vocational skills training, startup toolkits (productive assets), and group-based cash grants (up to $10,000 per group) to support income-generating activities after training[1][7]. While it shares characteristics with graduation programs — multi-faceted support including cash and productive assets aimed at raising incomes and reducing poverty — there is no evidence that YOP included all essential graduation program pillars such as consumption support, intensive coaching, or a time-bound handoff from social protection to self-employment. Leading evidence reviews and research (including those from J-PAL and the American Economic Association) refer to YOP as a high-impact livelihood program or a cash grant program, not as a graduation program per se[7]. Graduation programs typically target the ultra-poor with a tightly bundled set of sequenced interventions; YOP, while impactful, targeted youth irrespective of their ultra-poor status and did not provide explicit consumption support or coaching, key graduation criteria[4][6]. There is direct and strong evidence of a significant cash transfer component and intentional purchase of productive assets/tools[1][7]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://conference.iza.org/ELMPDC2009/martinez_s4899.pdf, https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Faeri.20190224, https://poverty-action.org/publication/long-term-impacts-grants-poverty-9-year-evidence-uganda%E2%80%99s-youth-opportunities-program",
