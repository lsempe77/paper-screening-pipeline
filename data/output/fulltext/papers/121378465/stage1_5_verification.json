  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Chicken production and social behavior change intervention' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The intervention referred to as 'Chicken production and social behavior change intervention' in Ethiopia matches the 'African Chicken Genetic Gains (ACGG) plus Agriculture to Nutrition (ATONU)' program. This program is not structured as a graduation or multi-component poverty program: its primary aim is agricultural productivity and nutrition improvement, not comprehensive poverty alleviation or multi-component 'graduation' from ultra-poverty as defined by the BRAC model[3][4][7]. There is no mention of regular cash transfers or cash stipends; participants do not receive money directly as part of the intervention[3][4]. Instead, the program provides productive assets (25 genetically improved chicks per household, with training and home gardening support), which clearly meets the criteria for an assets component[3][4][7]. The program focuses on improved household nutrition, behavior change, women's empowerment, and child health, not direct financial support or bundled graduation package (savings, mentoring, finance linkages, lump-sum asset grants, etc.). | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549301/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32652012/, https://www.anh-academy.org/sites/default/files/5B_Nilupa%20Gunaratna%20ANH2019.pdf",
