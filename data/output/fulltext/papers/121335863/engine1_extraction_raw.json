The paper does not describe any intervention components that would qualify for inclusion in a systematic review of graduation or cash transfer programs.\n\nThe paper uses panel data analysis to study economic convergence across 46 African countries from 1985-2005, focusing on macroeconomic outcomes rather than specific poverty reduction interventions. Therefore, while it's a research paper, it falls outside the scope of graduation/livelihood program evaluations."
