Search did not find relevant graduation programs in Kenya: Perplexity search result: The GiveDirectly Unconditional Cash Transfer Program in Kenya is not a graduation or multi-component poverty program as typically defined, such as those modeled on BRAC, which combine multiple supports (cash, assets, skills, mentoring). Instead, GiveDirectly focuses exclusively on delivering unconditional cash transfers directly to poor households, with recipients free to allocate funds as they choose. Peer-reviewed RCTs confirm the program's cash component and document substantial increases in consumption, psychological well-being, and household assets owned after receipt of transfers; however, GiveDirectly does not itself provide productive assets or bundled services—any asset accumulations are the result of recipients' independent choices using their cash. The program is officially named as stated, and sources from J-PAL, academic RCTs, and GiveDirectly’s website consistently describe a pure cash model without additional components. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7575201/, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/giving-directly-support-poor-households, https://www.givedirectly.org/kenya/",
