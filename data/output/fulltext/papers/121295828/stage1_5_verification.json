  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS/NREGS)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS/NREGS) is India's flagship public works program that provides a legal guarantee of 100 days of wage employment to rural households willing to do unskilled manual work. The wage payments (cash component) are a central feature of the program, directly providing income support to beneficiaries[3][5][6]. MGNREGS also mandates that the work undertaken must create durable community assets (such as roads, ponds, irrigation canals), which qualifies as a productive assets component[3]. However, MGNREGS is not classified as a 'graduation program' in the sense used for ultra-poor graduation models (like BRAC's, which combine cash, asset transfer, intensive coaching, and health/nutrition for the ultra-poor with a specified exit or graduation criteria). MGNREGS is a large-scale employment guarantee and public works scheme, not a multi-component graduation program for ultra poverty alleviation[2][3][4]. No evidence indicates a targeted asset transfer to individuals for livelihood start-up; assets are public goods. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi_National_Rural_Employment_Guarantee_Act,_2005, https://levyinstitute.org/publications/a-short-history-of-mgnrega-twenty-years-in-ten-charts, https://nrega.nic.in",
