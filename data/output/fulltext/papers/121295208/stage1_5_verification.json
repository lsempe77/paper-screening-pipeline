Search did not find relevant graduation programs in Zimbabwe: Perplexity search result: The Harmonized Social Cash Transfer Programme (HSCT) in Zimbabwe is an unconditional cash transfer program targeted at ultra-poor, labor-constrained households. Its primary goal is to provide regular bi-monthly cash payments to improve food security, reduce poverty, and prevent negative coping strategies among the most vulnerable[1][3][4]. There is no evidence from authoritative sources that the HSCT includes a graduation component (such as sequenced support towards sustainable livelihoods, typical of BRAC or IPA-style graduation models) or direct provision of productive assets. The program focuses on social protection via cash assistance to meet basic needs and reduce poverty, not on asset-building or integrating livelihoods support that characterizes graduation-style approaches[1][3][4]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/zimbabwe/, https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HSCT-Endline-Report_Final-v2.pdf, https://www.fao.org/agrifood-economics/publications/detail/en/c/379092/",
