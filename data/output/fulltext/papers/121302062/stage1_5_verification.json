  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'PRESAR (Projet de Réhabilitation du Secteur Agricole et Rural)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: There is no direct evidence in the search results that PRESAR (Projet de Réhabilitation du Secteur Agricole et Rural) in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a graduation or multi-component poverty program as specifically defined by the international 'graduation approach' (which includes sequenced interventions combining cash transfers, assets, training, and mentoring)[3][4][9]. The most prominent DRC graduation programs specifically referenced in current research and evaluations—such as those implemented by Women for Women International—are not PRESAR[2][5][7]. PRESAR is, by its name and previous mentions in sectoral reports, an agricultural sector rehabilitation program, generally aiming to improve rural agricultural productivity and livelihoods, but there is no precise evidence that it utilizes the graduation approach or provides direct cash transfers or productive assets as integral components. While PRESAR may provide agricultural support or development interventions, this is not synonymous with the graduation or ultra-poor-focused multi-component model. There is insufficient information online connecting PRESAR to cash transfers or asset provision per graduation program standards. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: MEDIUM | Sources: https://econ.washington.edu/sites/econ/files/documents/research/drc_1.pdf, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/sites/default/files/research-paper/AngelucciHeathNoble_DRC.pdf, https://www.concern.org.uk/knowledge-hub/graduation-programming-concern",
