  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Supreme Court Reforms (CT, eCourt, and SCP reforms)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The search results do not provide any evidence that 'Supreme Court Reforms (CT, eCourt, and SCP reforms)' in the Philippines is a graduation program (i.e., a targeted, sequenced poverty-reduction program for the ultra-poor, often modeled on BRAC or similar multi-component interventions). There is also no indication that these reforms provide cash transfers, stipends, or productive assets to beneficiaries, nor any linkage to ultra-poor or extreme poverty targeting, livelihood support, or evidence-based impact evaluation as typically found in graduation programs. Available information suggests that Supreme Court reforms refer to judicial and legal process improvements (e.g., digitization, efficiency, transparency), not to social protection interventions for the poor[6]. Furthermore, searches for keywords like 'cash transfers', 'productive assets', 'ultra poor', and 'livelihood' did not yield relevant results for this program in the context of the Philippines. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: None",
