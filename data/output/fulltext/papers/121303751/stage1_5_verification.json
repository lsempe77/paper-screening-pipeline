Official documentation shows these cooperatives function by scaling up productive partnerships, strengthening institutional capacity, and supporting poor households through improved access to infrastructure and productive assets, such as agricultural equipment, inputs, and training[1][2]. However, there is no clear evidence that the program systematically provides unconditional or conditional cash transfers (stipends) as a core method, nor does it follow the multi-component 'graduation' model characterized by sequences of asset building, training, direct cash transfers, and follow-up support commonly associated with programs modeled after BRAC. The program does provide productive assets and technical training. Some sources mention subsidies/loans and general financial support, but it cannot be confirmed these are universally direct cash transfers to individuals. Thus, it is not a graduation program, it does provide productive assets, and the cash component remains unclear due to lack of conclusive evidence. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/155421528486209661/pdf/Final-Technical-Assessment-Guangxi-Poverty-Reduction-Program-for-Results-P163138.pdf, https://thetricontinental.org/studies-1-socialist-construction/, https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-11-01/How-China-s-youth-are-being-educated-to-end-hunger-1HWgRI5BOhO/p.html",
