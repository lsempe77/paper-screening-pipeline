  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Village Fund Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Village Fund Program in Indonesia (Dana Desa) aims to alleviate rural poverty by channeling significant funds directly to villages for local development. It is not structured as a 'graduation' program in the sense of comprehensive, time-bound, multi-component approaches targeted specifically at ultra-poor households (as with BRAC or IPA-style graduation programs)[1][7]. Instead, it functions as a decentralized rural development program supporting wide-ranging infrastructure and economic empowerment activities, not as sequenced, holistic support for extreme poverty exit.\n\nThere is a major cash component: funds are transferred from central government to village governments, and evidence documents the creation of direct cash assistance initiatives under the program, such as Village Fund Direct Cash Assistance (Bantuan Langsung Tunai Dana Desa or BLT-DD)[5]. Some components of the program provide cash transfers for low-income villagers, especially during shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe assets component is also present: Village Fund Program funds have been widely used for building infrastructure (roads, irrigation, clean water) and for setting up 'village-owned enterprises' and village market facilities, thus providing productive assets to the community[2][3][4]. However, these are public or communal assets, not individualized productive asset packages as in typical graduation programs.\n\nTherefore, the Village Fund Program is a large-scale rural poverty reduction and empowerment initiative, with both cash disbursal and productive (public/community) asset components, but it does not fit the graduation model targeted at the ultra-poor. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://journal.kci.go.kr/japs/archive/articlePdf?artiId=ART002943125, https://setkab.go.id/en/village-funds-to-reduce-poverty-in-villages-minister-says/, https://kms.kemenkopm.go.id/index.php?p=fstream-pdf&fid=531&bid=70",
