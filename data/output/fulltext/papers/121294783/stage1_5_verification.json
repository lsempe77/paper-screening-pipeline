  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Urban Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP)'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Urban Productive Safety Net Program (UPSNP) in Ethiopia targets poor, extreme poor, and ultra-poor households and includes graduation mechanisms, where graduation means achieving food self-sufficiency and no longer needing external assistance[3]. The program provides multiple components: cash transfers, food, or vouchers to support beneficiaries in predictable ways[2][1]. Evidence also shows direct provision and facilitation of business capital and productive assets, such as training, livestock, and agricultural technologies to help participants build assets and livelihoods[1][3]. This multi-component design, with a clear graduation pathway, cash support, and asset-building interventions, fits the definitions of both graduation and multi-component poverty reduction programs. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/node/1392, https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/impact-urban-productive-safety-net-programme-poverty-reduction-food-security-evidence_en, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10844108/",
