  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Multiple livelihood interventions in Longnan mountain areas' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The sources discuss multiple livelihood and anti-poverty interventions in the Longnan mountainous area of China, emphasizing support measures that influence livelihood strategies among farming households. The evidence details support in the form of productive assets (e.g., industry promotion, technical support, training, workshops, etc.) targeting households who have exited poverty, aligning partly with multi-component or graduation-style programming[1][3]. However, there are no direct references or official program titles specifically labeled as 'graduation programs', nor explicit evidence of systematic cash transfer or stipend components offered as part of these interventions. The best-cited material analyzes how provision of various resources, skills, and support (which may include assets) affects post-poverty household livelihoods, but cash transfer information is not specified and no program is named as a graduation initiative in the international sense. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: MEDIUM | Sources: https://www.progressingeography.com/EN/10.18306/dlkxjz.2022.11.002, https://www.progressingeography.com/EN/10.18306/dlkxjz.2020.06.009",
