Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Women for Women International (WfWI) operates a 12-month social and economic empowerment programme in Afghanistan, which is described as a multi-component poverty graduation approach. The programme includes practical job skills training (such as tailoring, brickmaking, horticulture, and poultry-keeping), business management, financial literacy, and knowledge about rights and health. Participants receive a monthly stipend, which constitutes a cash transfer component. The programme also provides productive assets, as participants learn skills that directly translate into productive activities (e.g., poultry-keeping, tailoring), and graduates can access advanced business training with micro-capital support, which may include productive assets. The programme is explicitly designed for ultra-poor and extremely marginalized women, aligning with the graduation model used by organizations like BRAC and evaluated by J-PAL and IPA. The evidence from multiple sources confirms these components. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.cartierphilanthropy.org/partnerships/empowering-women-in-conflict-affected-countries, https://www.womenforwomen.org/graduate-support, https://www.womenforwomen.org/where-we-work/afghanistan",
