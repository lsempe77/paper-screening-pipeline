It is a multifaceted program targeting poor households and counties with tailored measures, combining interventions like infrastructure development, education, healthcare, relocation, and employment support[1][6][7]. The program does provide cash subsidies; for example, subsidies are offered to poor individuals participating in employment training, and they receive monetary rewards linked to earned income[4]. There is also provision of productive assets—examples include relocation to new homes (where households are provided with better housing/infrastructure) and industrial guidance, which supports agricultural development and other productive capacities[1][4]. However, the TPA is not a graduation program in the sense defined by BRAC, IPA, or J-PAL—that is, a sequenced intervention explicitly combining asset transfer, training, consumption support, and aiming for permanent economic 'graduation' among the ultra-poor. Instead, TPA is a large-scale, government-driven, multi-component poverty reduction campaign using several means at scale. It does not follow the strict graduation model or RCT literature from Bangladesh or similar contexts. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://voxchina.org/show-3-391.html, https://sccei.fsi.stanford.edu/china-briefs/how-participation-chinas-poverty-alleviation-campaign-affected-firm-performance-and, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation",
