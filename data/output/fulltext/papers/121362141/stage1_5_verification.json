Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) in Ethiopia is widely described—across multiple sources—as both a multi-component poverty program and one that has adopted the 'graduation' approach. The program provides regular cash or food transfers to poor and food-insecure households as part of its safety net, primarily through public works and direct support. Several sources confirm that graduation within PSNP refers to equipping households to sustainably meet their needs without further transfers, aligning explicitly with the graduation theory. Moreover, PSNP-linked graduation models (e.g., via SPIR) specifically provide livelihoods support and 'livelihood transfers'—which may be either productive assets in-kind or cash designated for asset purchase. This is supported by documentation describing subsidised asset transfers or cash transfers to kick-start economic activity. The program is referenced in graduation literature as an example of integrating cash, asset, and skills interventions to promote sustainable poverty escape, especially for ultra-poor households. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://www.care.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spir_learning_brief-sustainability_of_psnp_household_graduation-final_0.pdf",
