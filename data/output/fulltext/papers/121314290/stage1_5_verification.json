  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'FXBVillage program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources, including peer-reviewed studies and official program documents, describe the FXBVillage program in Rwanda and Uganda as a 'graduation' or multi-component poverty alleviation model targeting the ultra-poor[1][2][3][7][8]. The program provides sustained, sequenced material support over three years, including interventions in education, healthcare, housing, nutrition, and income generation. However, there is no evidence of unrestricted or regular cash transfers or stipends as part of the FXBVillage program. Instead, the model focuses on the provision of productive assets and in-kind support for income-generating activities, such as livestock, agricultural inputs, or small business inputs, which are referenced in both academic evaluations and official reports[1][2][7][8]. The core logic aligns with the global graduation model, where productive assets—rather than direct cash—are provided to catalyze sustainable livelihoods. | Graduation: YES, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27796413/, https://fxb.org/content/uploads/2025/01/Harhay-et-al-FXB-IJPH-2016.pdf, https://mcld.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-18-fxb-presentation.pdf",
