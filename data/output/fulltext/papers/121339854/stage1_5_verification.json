  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Kentucky Welfare Monitoring Study' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: There is no credible evidence that a program called 'Kentucky Welfare Monitoring Study' exists as an organized multi-component poverty or graduation program in the United States. The available search results discuss Kentucky's high school graduation initiatives and welfare reform outcomes, but none mention a dedicated program by this name, nor do they describe integrated graduation-style interventions (e.g., BRAC-style programs) with cash transfers or productive assets for the ultra poor. While Kentucky has implemented welfare reform policies that include work requirements and time limits on cash assistance for low-income families (mainly through TANF), these are not graduation programs as defined in international development literature—they do not offer integrated packages of cash, coaching, and assets. TANF may provide cash benefits, but there is no evidence that a specific 'Kentucky Welfare Monitoring Study' provides productive assets. The sources available do not mention randomized trials or impact evaluations under this program name. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://kybtn.mgcafe.uky.edu/sites/kybtn.ca.uky.edu/files/frontwacknowl.pdf, https://soapboxmedia.com/072816-report-nky-high-school-graduates/, https://new.every1graduates.org/for-all-kids-how-kentucky-is-closing-the-high-school-graduation-gap-for-low-income-students/",
