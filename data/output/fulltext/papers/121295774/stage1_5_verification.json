  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Oxfam Somalia Programme' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Based on available evidence, the Oxfam Somalia Programme is not described or branded as a 'graduation program' in the technical sense. Graduation programs are defined by an explicit, multi-step approach to moving ultra-poor households out of extreme poverty, as in the UPG model evaluated by IFPRI and World Vision in Somalia[1][7]. Oxfam’s work in Somalia focuses on humanitarian assistance and longer-term development, with activities including multi-purpose cash grants to empower communities to meet their needs[3]. Additionally, Oxfam's projects include skills trainings and agricultural cooperatives, such as greenhouses and vegetable production, which constitute provision of productive assets[2]. Direct references to combination approaches (cash + productive assets) linked to livelihoods and self-reliance are present, but without explicit reference to the graduation framework or multiphase sequencing characteristic of graduation programs. Therefore, while Oxfam Somalia Programme provides both cash transfers and productive assets, it is not a formal graduation program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.oxfam.org/en/what-we-do/countries/somalia, https://www.oxfam.ca/story/coding-crafting-cultivating-somali-women-securing-their-futures/, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evidence-effect/graduation-approach",
