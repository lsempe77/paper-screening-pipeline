While there is clear evidence that the HSR program contributes to poverty alleviation by enabling access to markets, boosting tourism, improving logistics, and creating employment opportunities (such as hiring local workers and paying wages during construction)[1][2][3], there is no indication that it is a 'graduation program' modeled after BRAC or J-PAL approaches (which typically involve direct cash transfers, stipends, or provision of productive assets to the ultra poor). The program does not include unconditional or conditional cash transfers, nor does it provide poor households with productive assets directly; rather, its benefits are indirect and structural. No component aligns with the direct transfer, asset provision, or structured multi-component interventions characteristic of recognized graduation programs. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: http://english.scio.gov.cn/pressroom/2020-11/19/content_76926182.htm, http://p.china.org.cn/2019-06/25/content_74918804.htm, http://en.people.cn/n3/2020/0829/c90000-9739769.html",
