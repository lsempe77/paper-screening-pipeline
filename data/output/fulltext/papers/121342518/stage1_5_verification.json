The project offers enhanced medical security through expanded insurance and medical assistance, reduces out-of-pocket health costs, and improves access to healthcare services[1][2][7]. Key interventions explicitly include increasing medical insurance coverage, subsidizing health-related costs, and improving health infrastructure, but there is no evidence in authoritative evaluations or policy descriptions of direct cash transfers, general stipends, or direct provision of productive assets (such as livestock, agricultural inputs, or business grants) commonly seen in graduation or multi-component livelihood programs[1][2][3][7]. The HPAP does not follow the model of graduation programs like BRAC or similar multi-faceted ultra-poor programs that include both unconditional cash transfers and asset transfers alongside training. Instead, it systematically focuses on reducing health-driven poverty traps via in-kind health benefits and system reforms. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10716013/, https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00469580251337232, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10785690/",
