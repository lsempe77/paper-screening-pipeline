  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Poverty alleviation policy in continuous poverty-stricken areas (CPSAs)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The CPSAs (Poverty alleviation policy in continuous poverty-stricken areas) in China is a broad, multi-component poverty policy focused on reducing poverty through regional targeting, infrastructure, education, relocation, and ecological livelihood projects. There is no evidence that the program fits the 'graduation' model (e.g., multi-step, time-bound ultra-poor livelihood transformation as with BRAC's graduation model)[2][4][6]. While cash transfer components could exist within China’s poverty alleviation portfolio, there is no specific documentation showing CPSAs having explicit, targeted cash transfer or stipend components for individual households—support is often indirect, such as free education, subsidized nutrition, and infrastructure funding[1][4]. However, there is strong evidence the program provides productive assets and support—examples include relocation (housing/buildings), ecological livelihood projects (farm tools, land, green development support), and vocational training, which yields productive skills[4][6][8]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: MEDIUM | Sources: https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2022/02/how-china-defeated-poverty/, https://en.qstheory.cn/2021-04/30/c_617642.htm, https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/bdadc16a4f5c1c88a839c0f905cde802-0070012022/original/Poverty-Synthesis-Report-final.pdf",
