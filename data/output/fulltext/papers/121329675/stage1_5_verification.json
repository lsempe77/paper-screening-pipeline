  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'MCA-N Transportation Project' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The MCA-N Transportation Project is officially referred to as the Millennium Challenge Account - Nicaragua Transportation Project. According to sources, this program's main focus is stimulating economic development through improved road transport infrastructure[3]. Detailed reviews of the program and evaluation reports indicate the project facilitated road rehabilitation and construction to improve connectivity and access[1][2][3], with the intent of fostering development and access to services. There is no evidence the program was designed as a graduation or multi-component poverty initiative (such as the BRAC or J-PAL model), nor did it include direct cash transfers or stipends. Similarly, there is no information suggesting the provision of productive assets to individuals or households; rather, the assets created were public roads and infrastructure, not direct transfers to the ultra-poor or recipients. The project did create some short-term labor opportunities via public works during construction, but this differs fundamentally from poverty graduation cash/asset schemes[2]. All available documentation from MCC, World Bank, and sector reports focus on infrastructure development—not direct poverty alleviation through graduation-style interventions. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.mcc.gov/resources/story/story-cbj-fy2022-appendix/, https://openjicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/12180998_02.pdf, https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstreams/327979bf-a622-5839-9212-e5cefab0f8ae/download",
