  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Ukrainian Social Assistance System' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Based on available sources, the Ukrainian Social Assistance System is a set of national social protection programs targeted at populations in poverty, such as people with disabilities, orphans, low-income families, and other vulnerable groups. It focuses primarily on providing social transfers—i.e., cash payments—to eligible beneficiaries[5][7]. There is no evidence that Ukraine's social assistance system has adopted the 'graduation approach' defined by BRAC, J-PAL, or major international best practices (i.e., combined interventions including productive asset transfer, skills training, and coaching as part of a multi-component livelihood program for the ultra-poor)[2][3][6][8]. Nor is there mention of transfers of business assets or explicit productive asset provision in available documentation on Ukraine's system. Therefore, it is not a graduation or multi-component poverty program in the sense used by BRAC or internationally. It does provide cash transfers, but not productive assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/11/30/social-assistance-programs-for-the-poor-and-vulnerable-in-ukraine-to-benefit-from-world-bank-support, https://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=5756&langId=en, https://www.banquemondiale.org/fr/results/2013/04/04/graduation-program-creating-pathways-out-of-extreme-poverty-into-sustainable-livelihoods",
