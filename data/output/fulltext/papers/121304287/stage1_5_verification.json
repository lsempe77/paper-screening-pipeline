The core component is resettlement and provision of government-built housing and infrastructure at the destination[2]. Comprehensive follow-up support for employment and quality of life is mentioned, but the program fundamentally consists of government-organized relocation and in-kind benefits in the form of apartments or housing[2]. There is no clear evidence in the most reliable academic sources that PAR provides direct cash transfers or stipends to participants[2][3][4]. However, productive assets such as housing and sometimes agricultural land or improved access to employment opportunities are commonly provided as part of the relocation package[2][3][4]. The structure does not match a graduation model, which typically combines multi-component livelihoods support (including cash, asset provision, coaching, and financial inclusion) with a clear path out of extreme poverty, as characterized by BRAC/J-PAL/IPA. Instead, PAR is primarily a relocation/in-kind resettlement program with linked employment facilitation and infrastructure investment. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0309534, https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2421526122, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40085656/",
