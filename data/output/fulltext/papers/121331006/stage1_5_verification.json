  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'China's National Poverty Alleviation Program (Third Wave)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: China's National Poverty Alleviation Program (third wave, often referred to as targeted poverty alleviation since 2013) is a comprehensive multi-component poverty program, not strictly a 'graduation' program as defined in BRAC (Bangladesh) or IPA/J-PAL literature. It provides a mixture of social protection benefits, including cash transfers and social assistance (minimum income guarantees), as well as productive asset support (housing renovation, infrastructure, agricultural subsidies, skills training, etc.)[1][3][6][8]. Multiple sources detail the provision of both minimum income support and asset provision, including housing upgrades, agricultural investments, and infrastructural development. The program is not structured as a time-bound, multi-step graduation model but rather as a large-scale multi-sectoral poverty initiative with local targeting and adaptation. The cash component is evidenced by references to 'minimum income' and educational scholarships, while the asset component is demonstrated by housing construction, agricultural upgrades, and educational infrastructure investments. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://thetricontinental.org/studies-1-socialist-construction/, https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents/ameizhang_0.pdf, https://amro-asia.org/an-exemplary-journey-in-eradicating-poverty/",
