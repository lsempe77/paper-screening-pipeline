  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'New Rural Collective Economies (NRCE)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The 'New Rural Collective Economies' in China refers primarily to a policy and legal framework that encourages collective rural development through unified management of assets, diversification of local economies, and improved governance structures[2][4][6]. These entities employ collective ownership and management of land and assets, often through shareholding cooperatives or village economic organizations. There is substantial evidence for the transfer, consolidation, and unified operation of productive assets at the village or town level, modernizing rural governance and operational norms[2][4][6]. However, there is no direct evidence in available sources that these policies or organizations provide cash transfers or stipends to individual poor households or operate as targeted 'graduation programs' for the extreme poor, as defined by multi-component interventions like BRAC or IPA models. Instead, their focus is on community-level asset management and income generation, not individualized cash support or ultra-poor targeting. The approach is collective and economic in scope, aimed at general rural revitalization and governance rather than individualized poverty graduation. Thus: (1) Not a graduation program; (2) Cash transfers are not clearly confirmed; (3) Productive assets are a central component. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: http://www.anbound.com/Section/ArticleView_33706_1.htm, https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1302545/full, https://monthlyreview.org/articles/communal-governance-and-production-in-rural-china-today/",
