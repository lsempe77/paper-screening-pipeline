It targeted low-income adults and families and offered a package of supports including earnings supplements (a type of cash transfer), child care subsidies, and health insurance for individuals who worked full time. Multiple MDRC evaluations confirm the program provided cash supplements to low-income workers[9]. However, there is no evidence the program distributed productive assets (such as livestock, tools, or business capital) as seen in 'graduation' or 'ultra-poor' frameworks inspired by BRAC, nor is it described as a graduation or multi-component livelihood program in that model. The program's focus was on making full-time work pay, rather than on facilitating a transition to self-employment or microenterprise. While the program produced positive impacts on employment, income, and child well-being, these effects stemmed from wage supplements and supportive services, not asset transfers or a graduation approach[9][3]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.mdrc.org/work/publications/new-hope-families-and-children/file-full, https://www.mdrc.org/work/publications/long-term-effects-new-hope-childrens-academic-achievement-and-achievement/file-full",
