  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'USAID agricultural and agribusiness productivity programs' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The 'USAID agricultural and agribusiness productivity programs' in Kenya—specifically, the Kenya Crops and Dairy Market Systems (KCDMS) project—focuses on agricultural training, strengthening market systems, and promoting improved seeds and conservation agriculture among horticulture and dairy farmers. The program's primary interventions are training, capacity-building, facilitating partnerships, and supporting access to improved agricultural inputs. There is no evidence in the available sources that KCDMS or similarly named USAID broad agricultural productivity programs in Kenya operate as classic 'graduation programs' (which are characterized by the sequenced delivery of cash or asset grants, intensive mentoring, and a time-bound exit/graduation) as defined by BRAC or cited by J-PAL/IPA. There is also no indication that the program involves direct cash transfers or productive asset grants to ultra-poor or extremely poor participants. Instead, the focus is on market systems, technical assistance, and enabling environment improvements. Graduation approach programs do exist in Kenya under USAID funding (such as USAID Nawiri), but those are distinct from the agricultural productivity programs referenced. Therefore, the program in question does not meet the tests for a graduation or multi-component poverty program, nor are there verified cash or asset transfer components. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://furtherafrica.com/2023/07/25/usaid-training-programme-benefits-over-300000-horticulture-and-dairy-farmers/, https://rti.org/news/rti-international-and-usaid-improve-agricultural-market-systems-and-reduce-poverty-and, https://globalagriculturalproductivity.org/gap-initiative-at-virginia-tech-archive/accelerating-agricultural-productivity-growth-in-east-africa-agenda-for-urgent-action/",
