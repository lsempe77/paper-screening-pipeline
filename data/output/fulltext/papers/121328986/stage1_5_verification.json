Internet search found graduation programs in Haiti: Perplexity search result: Multiple authoritative sources (including evaluation reports, international agencies, and NGO documentation) describe a 'graduation program' in Haiti implemented by Fonkoze, officially called Chemen Lavi Miyò (CLM). This is cited as a classic graduation approach modeled after BRAC, providing a comprehensive, multi-component support package aimed at the 'ultra poor.' The documented core components are: (1) cash transfers or stipends (often for consumption support in the initial phase), (2) transfer of productive assets (e.g., livestock, equipment), (3) training and intensive coaching, and (4) access to savings and basic health services. Evaluation summaries, including those from CGAP, World Bank, IDS, and the program itself, explicitly state the program both provides direct cash/consumption stipends and productive assets as part of the classic graduation package. These elements are referenced in at least 5 independent evaluations and overviews. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.cgap.org/blog/haitis-graduation-pilot-final-evaluationpromising-results, https://beyondborders.net/the-graduation-model-a-sustainable-way-out-of-extreme-poverty/, https://fonkoze.org/assets/fonkoze-clm-children-s-research---endline-report-final--13-oct-19-.pdf",
