  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'National Agriculture and Livestock Extension Programme (NALEP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Based on available information, the National Agriculture and Livestock Extension Programme (NALEP) is a Kenyan government initiative aimed at providing agricultural extension services, technology dissemination, and support to smallholder farmers to improve productivity and livelihoods. There is no credible evidence from government reports, BRAC, J-PAL, IPA, or World Bank evaluations linking NALEP to graduation or ultra-poverty programs. NALEP does not use the graduation model nor does it specifically target the ultra-poor with sequenced interventions typical of graduation programs (e.g., cash stipends, productive assets, intensive coaching). There is also no evidence that NALEP provides direct cash transfers or productive assets; its interventions are centered on training, capacity building, and technical support. All references to graduation programs in Kenya in the search results concern other programs (such as the PROFIT Graduation program) and not NALEP. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://bracupgi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BRAC_PROFIT-Financial-Graduation-Report-Nov-2019.pdf, https://poverty-action.org/evaluating-environmentally-focused-ultra-poor-graduation-program-kenya, https://peiglobal.org/sites/default/files/2024-11/IP7_ExtremePoverty_FINAL.pdf",
