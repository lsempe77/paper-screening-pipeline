  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Lesotho Child Grant Programme (CGP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Lesotho Child Grant Programme (CGP) is an unconditional cash transfer program targeted at poor and vulnerable households with children[1][2]. There is consensus in the literature and program documents that the CGP was not designed as a 'graduation' or multi-component poverty program: its main objective is to improve the wellbeing of children, and evaluations note there is no explicit graduation or exit strategy, nor is the cash size sufficient to allow graduation from poverty[1][4]. The CGP provides quarterly cash payments indexed to household child numbers[1][2]. While a pilot program (LFSSP) linked some CGP recipients to asset-type interventions like seeds and training, this was not a core CGP feature but a later, separate initiative for a subset of recipients[2]. No evidence suggests the main CGP systematically provides productive assets to all recipients, nor that it fits the typical graduation-program model that combines transfers, training, and assets[1][2][4]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a089d9ed915d3cfd00046c/a-i3848e.pdf, https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/lesotho/, https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/39/2/95/7033724",
