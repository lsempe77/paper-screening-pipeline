The MVP does not follow or implement the distinct 'graduation approach' (as developed by BRAC), which combines time-bound cash transfers and asset provision specifically to help the ultra-poor exit poverty through sequenced support. MVP provides a multi-component package (including agricultural inputs, health services, infrastructure development, and micro-credit), but there is no evidence that it delivers regular cash transfers or stipends to households as a core component. However, it does provide productive assets—such as seeds, fertilizer, livestock, and agricultural support—to participating communities. Notably, while some sources group MVP together with graduation programs in discussing 'big push' interventions, detailed program documentation and independent evaluations show MVP operates with broader development goals and modalities than graduation programs, and without a dedicated cash transfer component. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.millenniumpromise.org/new-millennium-village-site-aims-to-improve-lives-of-30-000-in-ghana, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Villages_Project, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID4135750_code2028252.pdf?abstractid=4135750",
