These programs have a core focus on providing poor rural communities with access to resources for essential social and productive infrastructure, primarily through **matching grants** (not pure cash transfers) to community associations. These grants are used for investments in small-scale infrastructure and productive assets, such as irrigation, beekeeping, and community facilities. The program does not provide recurring unconditional or conditional cash transfers or stipends to individuals or households; rather, funds are allocated as grants to community projects. These investments can include productive assets, meeting that criterion. Graduation programs, following the BRAC or IPA/J-PAL model, are characterized by a sequenced package that typically includes time-bound cash transfers, asset transfers for livelihoods, training, and close supervision. Brazil’s CDD programs do not systematically provide this integrated 'graduation' model and are not explicitly framed in that way in major program documentation or evaluation. Therefore, while these CDD programs do finance productive assets for ultra-poor rural communities, they are not classified as graduation programs and do not provide direct cash transfer payments. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/998221468743762314/pdf/308030BR0Northeast0ed01see0also0307591.pdf, https://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/sites/default/files/Data/reports/cdbcdd_brazil.pdf, https://scholarworks.umass.edu/bitstreams/2e3483c7-db50-4a8e-b681-dd78602d30e2/download",
