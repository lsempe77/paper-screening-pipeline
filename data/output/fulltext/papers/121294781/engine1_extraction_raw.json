This appears to be a study of government support programs in Vietnam, not a standard graduation program\n2. The paper describes two types of support: \"living support\" (housing/electricity) and \"human support\" (education/healthcare/occupation)\n3. There is no clear evidence of cash transfers or consumption support\n4. The program provides direct asset support in the form of housing and electricity infrastructure\n5. The study is observational with a sample size of 1,383 households\n6. The focus is on multidimensional poverty measurement and reduction\n\nThe paper does not appear to be evaluating a standard graduation program with the typical cash+assets components we look for. Instead, it's analyzing government support programs in Vietnam."
