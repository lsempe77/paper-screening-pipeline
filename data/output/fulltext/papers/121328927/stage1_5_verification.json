There is no direct indication in official documents or academic evaluations that PRS is itself a graduation or multi-component poverty 'graduation' program as understood internationally (e.g., providing sequenced support including cash, productive assets, training, and coaching). Rather, PRS coordinates and expands social protection and income support systems such as the National Aid Fund, and does propose time-bound, targeted interventions. The PRS is shown to have included cash assistance and support for beneficiaries through mechanisms like the National Aid Fund[3][5][6]. However, there is no clear evidence that PRS includes a productive assets transfer component typical of graduation programs; discussions of productive asset transfer and graduation programs in Jordan refer to separately piloted projects, such as RYSE, not the PRS. Thus, PRS has a cash component but is not a graduation program and does not systematically deliver productive assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pop4.291, https://www.mop.gov.jo/ebv4.0/root_storage/ar/eb_list_page/97742757-5f15-492a-8246-603d0abee8b2.pdf, https://www.undp.org/jordan/publications/jordan-poverty-reduction-strategy",
