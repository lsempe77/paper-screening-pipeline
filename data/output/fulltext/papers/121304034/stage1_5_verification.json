Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources confirm that the Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme (VUP) is designed as a graduation or multi-component poverty program in Rwanda, aiming to help the ultra-poor transition to sustainable livelihoods. Both academic analyses and government policy documents explicitly describe VUP's graduation strategy, which includes cash transfers, productive asset transfers, skills training, and complementary livelihood support[1][3][4][7]. The core VUP components cited include Direct Support (unconditional cash transfers), Public Works (labor income), and Financial Services (microfinance). Several evaluations and strategy documents specifically mention asset acquisition as an integral part of the graduation package, with recent implementation of livestock-based asset grants and business skills training. The program's official site, government PDFs, and independent impact reviews by organizations such as IDS and Concern Worldwide provide consistent evidence for all criteria: VUP is a graduation program with both cash and asset components. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/Evaluating_Graduation_Insights_from_the_Vision_2020_Umurenge_Programme_in_Rwanda/26458456, https://www.minaloc.gov.rw/index.php?t=f&f=57400&token=ebdc71608f1687253826e20e38990beebefe5c85, https://concernusa.org/whitepapers/understanding-post-programme-graduation-trajectories-in-rwanda-2020.pdf/",
