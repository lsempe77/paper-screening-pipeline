Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Islamic Microfinance in Bangladesh, specifically under Islamic Relief's Falah Graduation Model, is explicitly described as a graduation program inspired by BRAC's well-known approach. The program aims to lift ultra poor households out of extreme poverty through a multi-dimensional, sequenced set of interventions. According to the official Islamic Relief Worldwide guidelines for the Falah Graduation Model, the approach contains four core pillars: basic needs and social protection, livelihoods promotion, financial inclusion, and social empowerment. These pillars encompass both cash transfers (stipends for immediate needs) and productive assets (e.g., livestock, equipment) to support sustainable livelihoods. Multiple evaluation and program documents reference Islamic Relief's graduation work in Bangladesh including the HELP-UP and ALO projects, which incorporated both asset transfers and cash stipends as standard, in line with global graduation framework best practices. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://islamic-relief.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IRWFalahGraduationModel-Summary.pdf, https://reliefweb.int/report/world/falah-graduation-model-pathways-prosperity-guidelines",
