  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) Strategy' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) Strategy, adopted officially in 2014 in China, was a multi-pronged, high-profile poverty alleviation campaign led by the government to eradicate absolute poverty, particularly in rural areas[1][4][7][8]. Available sources show that the TPA provided a combination of interventions: it included large-scale social assistance and financial transfers to poor areas (cash and in-kind support) as well as investment in public services, relocation programs, skills training, and, critically, the development of productive industries in poor communities[4][1][3]. Evidence from implementation details and evaluations confirms that funds allocated for poverty alleviation included both direct transfers to poor households (cash/social assistance) and the provision of resources and opportunities for income generation, such as livestock, agricultural inputs, infrastructure, and job placement, constituting productive assets[4]. However, TPA is NOT a 'graduation program' in the technical sense, as defined by the BRAC or CGAP model involving a sequenced approach (i.e., combining cash, assets, training, life skills, and savings, followed by time-limited support and formal graduation criteria). TPA is a multi-component, state-led campaign employing a broad set of targeted measures simultaneously rather than staged components with a graduation exit. The TPA program's official name matches what is specified. Confidence is high given convergence of evidence from official documents, peer-reviewed research, and international organizations. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7551026/, https://regional.chinadaily.com.cn/Qiushi/2024-12/03/c_1049879.htm",
