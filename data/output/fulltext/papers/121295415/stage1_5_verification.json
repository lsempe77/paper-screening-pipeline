  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) 1000' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: LEAP 1000 is officially described as a social cash transfer program for extremely poor households in Ghana, providing both cash payments and enrollment in the national health insurance scheme[4][5]. Its primary aim is poverty alleviation and shock resilience, targeting households with pregnant women and children under 12. Multiple evaluation reports and program documents detail the cash transfer mechanism but do not describe LEAP 1000 as adopting the multi-component 'graduation approach' found in programs directly modeled after BRAC (such as those evaluated by J-PAL/IPA). There is no evidence from the official baseline report or external assessments of LEAP 1000 offering direct productive asset transfers to beneficiaries, nor additional components typical of graduation models like intensive training or coaching, or bundled services aimed at 'graduating' participants from poverty[4][5]. The core program for LEAP (including LEAP 1000) does not align with graduation program minimum standards as referenced in graduation handbooks and BRAC-style impact evaluations[1][2]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/LEAP-1000-Baseline-Report_2016.pdf, https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/document/ghana-leap-1000-programme-baseline-evaluation-report, https://leap.mogcsp.gov.gh/organizational-structure/",
