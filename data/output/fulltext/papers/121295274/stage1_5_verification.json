  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Cash/Food Transfer with Nutrition BCC Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The 'Cash/Food Transfer with Nutrition BCC Program' in Bangladesh refers to a component of the Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI), which tested various combinations of monthly cash or food transfers with or without nutrition behavior change communication (BCC) for poor rural women with young children. Multiple high-quality sources (including peer-reviewed RCTs and IFPRI/World Bank reports) confirm that the program provided regular cash transfers (1,500 taka/month) or equivalent value food rations, the cash being paid directly to mothers, typically via mobile money. The nutrition BCC was delivered as in-person sessions to address child and maternal nutrition. None of the experimental arms in these studies provided productive assets (such as livestock, equipment, seeds, or capital) typical of graduation programs. Graduation programs are characterized by a package that aims to move ultra-poor households into sustainable livelihoods through asset transfers, cash support, skills training, and coaching; this program was designed to test the impact of cash, food, and information interventions on nutrition and poverty, not to build productive assets or livelihoods. Therefore, it is not a graduation program and does NOT contain a productive asset component, but definitely provides unconditional cash (and/or food) transfers. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://academic.oup.com/wber/article/39/2/439/7680205, https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/776a7b03-1974-4fb6-befd-01191d763e3c, https://www.ifpri.org/project/transfer-modality-research-initiative-tmri/",
