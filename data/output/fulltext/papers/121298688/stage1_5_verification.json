  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'New Policy for Innovative Transformation in Regional Industrial Chains' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: There is no evidence that a program specifically named 'New Policy for Innovative Transformation in Regional Industrial Chains' exists as a formal, social protection or anti-poverty initiative in China. The closest related initiatives, as outlined in China's 14th Five-Year Plan and recent policy briefings, focus on industrial modernization, innovation-led growth, and supporting the competitiveness of industrial clusters and enterprises through subsidies, industrial funds, technology adoption incentives, and infrastructure upgrades. These are aimed at transforming the industrial structure and improving productivity, rather than directly targeting extreme poverty, ultra-poor households, or providing multipronged (graduation model) support typical of programs like BRAC's graduation approach. There is no indication that these policies provide individual or household-level cash transfers, stipends, or in-kind transfers of productive assets for the poor, as would be required for classification as a graduation or multi-component poverty program. The focus is squarely on industrial and enterprise development with macroeconomic aims, not social protection or individual poverty alleviation. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-policy-driven-industrial-initiatives-2025/, https://www.fujian.gov.cn/english/news/202108/t20210809_5665713.htm, https://ucigcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Naughton-Seven-Technologies-3.19.24.pdf",
