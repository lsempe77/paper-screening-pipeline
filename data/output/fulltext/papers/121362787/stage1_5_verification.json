  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Xiushui Model' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: A thorough search of sources including official Chinese government reports, World Bank documents, independent development analyses, and reputable news outlets produced no direct references or credible descriptions of a poverty program known as the 'Xiushui Model' in China. While 'Xiushui Village' exists [7], and some sources mention model poverty alleviation projects in China more broadly [1][3][4], none specifically document a program with the name 'Xiushui Model' or its purported multi-component graduation approach (involving sequenced cash transfers and productive asset provision) as defined by international best practices (similar to BRAC or IPA Graduation Models [6][8]). Given the lack of substantive and program-specific information, there is no basis to conclude that such a program exists or meets the defining criteria of a graduation or multi-component poverty program. Furthermore, there are no references to cash or asset components tied to the 'Xiushui Model.' Any claim about program modality would be speculation. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: LOW | Sources: https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/ezine/2007-07/04/content_909500.htm, https://thetricontinental.org/studies-1-socialist-construction/, https://en.people.cn/n3/2020/1207/c90000-9796371.html",
