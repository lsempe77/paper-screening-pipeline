  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Individual Development Accounts (IDAs)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) program in the United States is not a graduation program as typically defined by development organizations (BRAC, World Bank, J-PAL)—which are multi-component, time-bound interventions that combine cash or food assistance, skills training, asset transfers, and coaching to help extremely poor households—but rather a matched savings and financial literacy program for low-income individuals and families, including refugees[1][3][4]. There is no evidence of recurring, unconditional cash transfers or stipends; instead, participants save their own money in special accounts, sometimes supplemented by government or nonprofit matching grants only if savings are used for approved purposes[1][2][3]. While the program does not provide direct productive asset transfers (such as livestock, tools, or seed capital), it enables participants to use matched funds to purchase approved assets (e.g., homes, vehicles, or business equipment), effectively providing an indirect productive asset support mechanism[3][4]. The program also requires financial education, consistent with asset-building, but not the full package of livelihood training, consumption support, and asset grants found in graduation programs[1][3][4]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.cadcom.org/ida, https://iine.org/what-we-do/welcoming-resettlement/individual-development-account/, https://acf.gov/orr/programs/refugees/ida",
