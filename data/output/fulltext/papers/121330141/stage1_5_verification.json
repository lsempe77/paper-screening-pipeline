  "reasoning": "[Generic Description - Country Search] Paper mentions 'Graduation programme'. Internet search found graduation programs in Rwanda: Perplexity search result: Multiple authoritative sources confirm the existence of a graduation program targeting ultra-poor households in Rwanda. The 'Graduation Programme' in Rwanda refers to a multi-component poverty alleviation initiative that provides both cash transfers and productive asset transfers. Evidence from Concern Worldwide's briefing explicitly states the program's success is due to 'the full package of support being delivered – cash transfers, asset transfers, access to savings, and training.' Further, the IDS and Concern Worldwide papers, as well as evaluations and case studies, all clarify that Rwanda's program is designed as a graduation approach, aiming for sustainable poverty exit via integrated social protection, productive asset provision, and financial inclusion. The program is nationally referenced as Rwanda's 'Graduation Programme,' sometimes called the 'Sustainable Graduation program.' Research linked in these sources (including evaluations by BRAC, J-PAL, and Village Enterprise) verify that both cash and productive assets are core components of Rwanda’s approach, differentiating it from cash-only models like GiveDirectly's. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://concernusa.org/whitepapers/rwanda_graduation_final_briefing_paper_19.10.16.pdf/, https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/ndownloader/files/48237037, https://www.givedirectly.org/work-with-government-2024/",
