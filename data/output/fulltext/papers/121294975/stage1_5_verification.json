  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'South African Social Grants Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The South African Social Grants Program is a national system of unconditional cash transfers, including the Child Support Grant, Old Age Grant, Disability Grant, and others, designed as ongoing social assistance rather than a graduation or multi-component poverty program. It does not incorporate time-limited, bundled interventions designed to permanently move recipients out of poverty, such as the 'graduation approach' pioneered by BRAC. The program provides regular cash payments to eligible individuals or households based on defined criteria, but does not typically provide productive assets or business support as part of its standard operations[4][7]. However, there is a recent pilot initiative—the Generating Better Livelihoods (GBL) project—being trialed in partnership with government and BRAC to test a graduation approach for a selected subgroup of social grant recipients, but this is not representative of the core national program; it is a limited-scope pilot aiming to support several hundred (eventually up to 500,000) out of more than 19 million grant beneficiaries. Therefore, the extension of a graduation approach remains at the pilot stage and is not inherent to the main social grants program. The grants program has always had a central cash component and lacks a productive assets distribution component in its standard form. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.dsd.gov.za/index.php/21-latest-news/562-roundtable-discussion-focuses-on-graduating-social-grants-beneficiaries-out-of-poverty, https://finmark.org.za/GBL/, https://iej.org.za/the-pitfalls-of-poverty-targeting-systemic-exclusion-from-a-south-african-social-assistance-transfer/",
