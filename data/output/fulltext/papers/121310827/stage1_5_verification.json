Its core components include promoting monetary savings for children's education, providing mentorship, and supporting family-level income-generating projects (i.e., microenterprise development)[2]. While these components overlap with some graduation program features, the program does not fit the classic graduation model (which includes time-limited cash transfers, productive asset transfers, and intensive coaching as an integrated package specifically targeted at the ultra-poor)[4]; instead, it focuses on matched savings accounts (not direct cash transfers or stipends) and microenterprise training/support. The matched savings in their Child Development Accounts can only be withdrawn for specific purposes (education or microenterprise)[1], and this restriction distinguishes them from direct unconditional or conditional cash transfers. Supporting evidence consistently confirms productive asset or microenterprise support as a component (workshops and promotion of family-level income-generating activities)[2]; however, the program is not described in the literature as a graduation or multi-component poverty program targeting ultra-poverty, nor does it provide actual free-standing cash transfers to households. It is recognized more broadly as an 'economic empowerment' or 'multifaceted' intervention. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8846219/, https://ichad.wustl.edu/suubi-maka/, https://poverty-action.org/impact-graduation-program-livelihoods-refugee-and-host-communities-uganda",
