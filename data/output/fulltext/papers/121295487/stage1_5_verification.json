It is not a graduation or multi-component poverty program targeting the ultra-poor or extreme poor, as described in the literature. The scheme provides infrastructure (irrigation systems, canals, and water distribution networks) which qualifies as productive assets, but there is no evidence that it provides direct cash transfers or stipends to participants. The scheme is managed jointly by the government and a cooperative society, and focuses on improving water use efficiency, agricultural output, and adoption of sustainable farming practices. There is no mention of cash transfers, graduation criteria, or targeting of the poorest households as seen in typical graduation programs (e.g., BRAC, J-PAL, IPA, or World Bank graduation models). | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11141451/, https://www.asareca.org/when-an-african-farmer-earns-usd8276-in-a-year-we-call-it-success-how-asareca-and-partners-virtual-irrigation-academy-tool-are-turning-around-smallholder-irrigated-farming-in-uganda/, https://www.esaffuganda.org/post/agroecology-school-spearheading-the-transition-of-chemically-ravaged-mubuku-irrigation-scheme",
