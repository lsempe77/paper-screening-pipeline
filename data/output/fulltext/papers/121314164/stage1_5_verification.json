  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Pwani Project' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: All search results refer to the 'Pwani Project' in the context of Pwani University graduation ceremonies, including awards of diplomas and degrees, not a poverty alleviation or economic inclusion program. There is no evidence linking this to a multi-component poverty graduation model, nor any mention of cash transfers or provision of productive assets for the ultra poor or extreme poverty groups. The program is academic in nature and related to university education, not social protection. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.scribd.com/document/796971436/12th-Graduation-Programme-November-2024-FINALupdated, https://www.pu.ac.ke/Graduation%20Booklets/The%20Graduand%20Magazine%20-%2012th%20Graduation-November%202024%20-%20Complete%20for%20Print%20(updated%2006-11-2024).pdf, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI4vAVmCnkk",
