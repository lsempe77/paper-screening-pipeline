It operates under the Ghana Commercial Agriculture Project (GCAP) and involves the rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, including dams and canals, as well as support for improved farm management and extension services[1][3]. There is no evidence from credible sources or evaluation literature that the scheme provides direct cash transfers or stipends to participants, nor does it operate as a 'graduation' or multi-component poverty alleviation program in the sense used by organizations like BRAC or the World Bank. However, the program does provide productive assets in the form of irrigation infrastructure and technical support to farmers, enabling them to cultivate crops throughout the year. The literature only mentions increased access to physical assets (irrigation systems) but not direct asset transfers like livestock or inputs typical of graduation programs[1][2][3]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/562381551155323317/pdf/Final-ESMP-Tono-Irrigation-Scheme.pdf, https://wagrinnova.csic.es/innovation-hubs/irri-gh-tono-irrigation-scheme-in-the-upper-east-region-of-ghana/, https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/articles/watering-of-agricultural-activities-and-poverty-reduction-in-northen-ghana-a-case-study-of-the-tono-irrigation-scheme-in.pdf",
