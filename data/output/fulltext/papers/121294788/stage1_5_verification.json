  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'China's Targeted Poverty Alleviation Policy' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: China’s Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) is a multi-component, nation-wide anti-poverty campaign officially launched in 2014. The program deploys a mix of interventions—including cash components (subsidies, social assistance, and rewards for income generation) and productive asset components (support for industry development, job creation, relocation programs which often provide new housing, and investments in rural infrastructure and competitive industries). The TPA’s approach is systematic, broad, and tailored, but it does not specifically follow the 'graduation program' model as defined by organizations like BRAC or J-PAL, which typically involve a standardized sequence of interventions geared toward the ultra poor with time-bound exit strategies to promote self-sufficiency. Rather, the TPA synthesizes cash support, targeted asset transfers (e.g. subsidies for agricultural production, employment programs, relocation with new homes), and public investments but not in an explicit 'graduation' sequence. Evidence of both cash and asset components is found in government documents, academic evaluations, and policy descriptions. For example: cash transfers are confirmed through subsidies and rewards for employment participation, while asset support is corroborated by programs facilitating industry development, provision of new homes through relocation, and infrastructure investment. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/05/Xie_Presentation-Lunyu-XIE1.pdf, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7551026/",
