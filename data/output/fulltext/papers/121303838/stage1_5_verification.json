Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Income-generating activities (IGA) programme in Bangladesh is directly referenced as a multi-component poverty reduction initiative targeting extreme poor households. It provides time-bound support centered around developing sustainable livelihoods and income-generating activities, closely aligning with the graduation approach pioneered by BRAC in Bangladesh[3][4][5][6]. ADRA Bangladesh's IGA programs provide both productive assets (e.g., sewing machines) and cash grants to participants for business start-up, which matches the graduation model's core components: asset transfer and cash/consumption support[1]. Direct evidence includes cash transfers (e.g., BDT 5,000) and asset distribution, confirmed in recent implementations targeting slum communities[1]. The graduation framework includes criteria for successful livelihood selection, asset transfer, savings, and skills training, all evidenced in the program's design and results (improved nutrition, asset accumulation, diversified income)[2][4][6]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.adrabangladesh.org/single-post/vulnerable-communities-are-sustaining-their-livelihoods-with-iga-training, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31512574/, https://www.acdivoca.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Field-guide-graduation-approach-simplified.pdf",
