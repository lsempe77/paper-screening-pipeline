  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Nigerian Microfinance Banking Scheme' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The 'Nigerian Microfinance Banking Scheme' refers broadly to microfinance initiatives overseen by the Central Bank of Nigeria and not to a specific targeted graduation or multi-component poverty program. Microfinance banks in Nigeria primarily offer microloans (credit), not unconditional or conditional cash transfers typical of graduation models, nor are there explicit indications of systematic asset transfers like livestock or tools. The literature emphasizes microcredit for entrepreneurship and poverty reduction, noting high dropout rates and often limited impact on 'graduation' from poverty. While microfinance may lead to increased income or assets indirectly (if loans are invested successfully), this is not structured as an assets transfer component, nor is there clear evidence of cash stipends. The microfinance model in Nigeria does not follow the BRAC-style graduation program's sequence of targeting, consumption support (cash/food), assets transfer, and coaching—this is corroborated by both academic studies and sector reviews. No official program titled 'Nigerian Microfinance Banking Scheme' is present in recognized international graduation program listings. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://ijedp.com/upload/Vol%2006%20No.%2001%2008.pdf, https://armgpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2-2.pdf, https://d-nb.info/1186316691/34",
