  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Concern Worldwide Graduation Projects'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources directly confirm that Concern Worldwide has implemented graduation programs in both Burundi and Rwanda since at least 2012, with operational research and documented results. Source [2] describes the Burundi program as consisting of five components: comprehensive targeting, provision of income support (explicitly in the form of cash transfers where feasible), skills training/coaching, facilitated access to financial services, and a capital/asset transfer to support economic activities. This matches the multi-component graduation model, including both cash and productive asset transfers. Source [5] further describes the Green Graduation variant in both countries, confirming training, financial services, and resources, which corroborates the provision of both cash and productive assets. The official program names referenced include 'Terintambwe: Taking a Step Forward' and 'Green Graduation', both operated by Concern Worldwide. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://concernusa.org/reports/burundi_graduation_research_brief_2017.pdf/, https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/graduation-model-event-overview-discussions, https://www.concern.org.uk/news/difference-two-years-makes-families-living-extreme-poverty",
