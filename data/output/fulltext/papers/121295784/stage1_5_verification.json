  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Forest Management Cooperatives' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Forest Management Cooperatives in Ethiopia are primarily institutions established as part of participatory forest management (PFM) approaches, aiming to empower local communities to sustainably manage and benefit from forests. These cooperatives focus on developing forest management plans, protection, and legal forest product utilization. There is no evidence that these cooperatives are designed as multi-component anti-poverty 'graduation' programs akin to BRAC or PSNP graduation models, which involve carefully sequenced asset provision, cash transfers, and intensive support specifically for ultra-poor households. Available documentation describes the establishment of cooperatives, participatory forest assessment, management planning, capacity building, and benefit sharing, but does not mention unconditional or regular cash transfers to members. While there may be economic benefits or in-kind support (such as the right to harvest products or share profits from sustainable management), there is no clear information on the distribution of productive assets (e.g., livestock, equipment, start-up capital) to cooperative members in the sense used by graduation programs. Thus, the program is not a graduation program, does not provide cash transfers, and it is unclear whether substantial productive assets are directly distributed. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.farmafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/participatory-forest-management-in-ethiopia.pdf, https://ewnra.et/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/REDD-PFM-project-document.docx",
