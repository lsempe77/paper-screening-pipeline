  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: China's Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program, launched around 2014-2015, is the government's flagship anti-poverty initiative designed to systematically identify poor households and provide them with tailored support. However, TPA is not categorized in the academic literature as a 'graduation program' in the sense used by the international development community (e.g., BRAC, IPA, J-PAL), which typically refers to sequenced, time-bound, multi-component interventions leading to sustainable exit from extreme poverty. TPA involved multiple approaches, including cash transfers (such as conditional subsidies and employment-linked cash rewards cited in presentations from Chinese social policy scholars), relocation assistance, subsidies for training, and public works. Reports reference 'one-time financial or material support' to lift households above the poverty line, confirming a cash component, but there is insufficient direct evidence in the reviewed sources of a systematic program of productive asset transfers (e.g., livestock, equipment) akin to those in international graduation models. Some TPA interventions may have included material support, but it is not clear these were structured as productive asset transfers with training and follow-up as core elements. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://www.china-ces.org/Files/3058abstract/202412170201434113.pdf, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/05/Xie_Presentation-Lunyu-XIE1.pdf",
