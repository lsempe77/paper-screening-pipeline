  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Odisha Tribal Empowerment and Livelihoods Program (OTELP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: OTELP is designed to improve the quality of life, food security, and livelihoods of poor tribal households by supporting access to land, water, forests, and facilitating off-farm enterprise development, along with capacity-building and skills training[1][2]. The program involves multi-component interventions such as enhancing access to productive resources (land, water, forestry), and promoting wage employment that provides cash payments and, partially, payments in-kind (food grains)[2]. These efforts indicate a combination of livelihood support and productive asset creation. However, despite its multi-component design similar to some graduation programs, OTELP does not explicitly follow the 'graduation' approach as globally characterized (with integrated asset transfer, coaching, and temporary cash transfer modules as in BRAC or J-PAL graduation models)[3][9]. No source directly refers to OTELP as a graduation program, nor does it cite randomized trials or impact evaluations typical of such programs. The program does include cash components in the form of wage employment, and assets components in access to natural resources and enterprise support[2]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.gramvikas.org/project/odisha-tribal-empowerment-livelihoods-programme/, https://otelp.org/Right_Information.asp?id=6, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/blog/12-13-23/graduation-approach-updated-insights-and-best-practices-scale",
