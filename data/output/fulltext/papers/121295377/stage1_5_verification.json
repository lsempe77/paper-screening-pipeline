Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia is widely recognized as a large-scale social protection program that provides both cash and food transfers to millions of rural Ethiopians, primarily through labor-based public works or direct support[3]. The program has explicit graduation objectives aimed at moving households out of chronic food insecurity towards sustainable livelihoods. Multiple sources, including program evaluations and academic literature, confirm that PSNP seeks to achieve graduation through a combination of predictable cash/food transfers and complementary livelihood investments, including asset transfers and access to credit. Graduation models—often layered by NGOs or government—have been implemented as part of or alongside the PSNP to enhance income, resilience, and asset accumulation[1][2][4][6]. While the effectiveness of graduation in terms of fully lifting households out of poverty has been debated, there is clear evidence that the program includes both cash components (transfers) and productive assets as part of its design, particularly in graduation-oriented pilots and program expansions. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://essp.ifpri.info/2025/10/13/graduating-from-ethiopias-productive-safety-net-programme-what-have-we-learned/, https://www.ids.ac.uk/projects/ethiopia-productive-safety-net-programme/",
