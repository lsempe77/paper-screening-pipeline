  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are not a specific poverty graduation or multi-component social protection program; rather, they are a set of eight global development goals adopted by the United Nations in 2000 to address a broad range of development challenges, including poverty eradication, by 2015. MDGs serve as a global framework for development policy and advocacy, not as an implementable program that provides direct interventions such as cash transfers or productive asset support. While the MDGs aimed to 'eradicate extreme poverty and hunger,' they did so through collective targets and encouraged countries and organizations to develop programs and policies aligned with these objectives. Graduation programs, in contrast, are time-bound, holistic interventions often pioneered by organizations like BRAC, specifically designed to lift ultra-poor households out of poverty and documented to use approaches such as cash and asset transfers. Since the MDGs themselves are neither a graduation program nor an intervention providing cash or asset components directly, the answer for those criteria is 'NO' or 'UNCLEAR.' No evidence in the provided sources or authoritative literature links MDGs as a direct provider of cash or productive asset transfers. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/, https://www.cgap.org/blog/ending-extreme-poverty-new-evidence-on-graduation-approach, https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2013/04/04/graduation-program-creating-pathways-out-of-extreme-poverty-into-sustainable-livelihoods",
