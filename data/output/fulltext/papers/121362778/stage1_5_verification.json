The program centers on expanding kiwi fruit cultivation, providing technical training to farmers, introducing improved fruit varieties, and supporting agricultural enterprises[1][2][4][10]. While the initiative helps impoverished households increase income and obtain employment through participation in kiwi farming, there is no evidence of direct cash transfers or stipends to target populations. Similarly, there is no indication of a formal graduation program structure typical of multi-component poverty alleviation programs such as the BRAC model. The program does involve distribution or support for productive assets—specifically the provision of kiwi fruit seedlings/varieties, technical training, and establishment of demonstration zones, which are essential assets for agricultural livelihoods[1][4][10]. All evidence suggests the primary poverty alleviation mechanism is through enabling access to kiwifruit farming and related productive assets, not cash transfers or multi-step graduation program components. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: http://en.people.cn/n3/2018/0802/c90000-9487034.html, https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1043604, http://p.china.org.cn/2021-10/20/content_77821045.htm",
