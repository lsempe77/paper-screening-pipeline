Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia is widely recognized as a multi-component poverty alleviation program designed to improve food security and enable graduation from poverty. Evidence shows the PSNP both delivers regular cash transfers (and/or food transfers) to beneficiaries through public works or direct support[4] and explicitly includes 'graduation' as a core goal, with structured benchmarks for beneficiaries to exit the program based on improved livelihoods[3][5][6]. Graduation is mainly measured through the accumulation of productive assets, primarily livestock, which is emphasized both in policy and practice. The program has also piloted and incorporated 'graduation' models directly inspired by the BRAC approach, supported by the CGAP-Ford Foundation Graduation Program[1][2]. Multiple impact evaluations and official documentation confirm the cash transfer component and the focus on building productive assets (notably livestock) for sustainable livelihoods and graduation from extreme poverty. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://essp.ifpri.info/2025/10/13/graduating-from-ethiopias-productive-safety-net-programme-what-have-we-learned/, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10844108/",
