Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources confirm that the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) in Ethiopia is designed as a multi-component social protection program and has integrated the graduation approach. The PSNP provides regular cash and/or food transfers to impoverished households as its foundational component, aimed at meeting immediate consumption needs[3][7]. Furthermore, research and program descriptions indicate that PSNP serves as the base for graduation model interventions in Ethiopia, explicitly incorporating livelihood support and asset-building components. For instance, the SPIR ('Strengthen PSNP Institutions and Resilience') project builds on PSNP support and includes livelihood and nutrition interventions, as well as asset transfers, to encourage sustainable improvements and ultimate 'graduation' from extreme poverty[2]. These findings are supported by a graduation pilot evaluation linked directly to PSNP, which details success in credit and asset accumulation for beneficiaries[1][4]. Therefore, PSNP includes both cash transfer and asset-building elements, and is widely recognized in the literature as an example of a graduation or multi-component poverty alleviation program. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.ids.ac.uk/projects/ethiopia-productive-safety-net-programme/, https://ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia",
