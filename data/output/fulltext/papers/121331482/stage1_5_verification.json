  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Special Program Uprooted (PED)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: No credible online sources reference a program in Colombia named 'Special Program Uprooted (PED)' related to graduation, cash transfers, or productive asset provision for the extremely poor or displaced populations. Searches yielded no results from known graduation program databases (e.g., Ford Foundation's graduation case study on Colombia, which only references 'Produciendo por Mi Futuro') or reputable social protection reviews. There is evidence of graduation approach pilots in Colombia targeting the extreme poor and displaced (internally displaced persons), but none under the name 'Special Program Uprooted (PED).' Thus, there is insufficient information to verify its existence or components. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: LOW | Sources: https://www.fordfoundation.org/learning/library/research-reports/graduation-approach-case-study-colombia/",
