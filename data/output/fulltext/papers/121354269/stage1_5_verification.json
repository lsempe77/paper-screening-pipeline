  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Indonesian Social Safety Net Programmes' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Indonesian Social Safety Net Programmes (JPS) were launched in 1998 as a crisis response to protect poor and vulnerable households. They included multiple components: subsidized rice sales, public works (padat karya), health and education subsidies, and conditional cash transfers. According to major evaluations, the core components were targeted cash assistance (including cash transfers and scholarships) and wage employment through public works, but there is no evidence that JPS itself included the core 'graduation program' elements such as a structured, time-bound approach combining cash, asset transfers, livelihoods training, and coaching. Productive asset transfer (e.g., livestock, inventory) as featured in graduation programs is not documented within JPS. Separate later pilots in Indonesia (post-2013) adapted the Graduation Approach, but these are not considered part of the original or mainstream JPS programs. The cash transfer element is well-documented via CCTs, public works, scholarships, and food subsidies. Productive asset provision is not mentioned as a standard feature of the JPS. Therefore, while JPS is a multi-component social protection program and includes cash components, it does not meet the definition of a graduation program, nor does it provide productive assets in the traditional sense. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://smeru.or.id/en/publication/assessing-impact-indonesian-social-safety-net-programs-household-welfare-and-poverty, https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/digitising-social-safety-net-lessons-indonesia, https://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Periodicals/De/040_1/02_01_01_46_pdf.html",
