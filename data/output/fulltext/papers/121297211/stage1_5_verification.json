  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Targeted Poverty Alleviation (Jingzhun fupin)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) in China is a broad government-led strategy implemented from 2014/2015, designed to eradicate absolute poverty through a multifaceted approach. TPA does not fit the strict definition of a 'graduation program'—which refers to a specific intervention model originally developed by BRAC and replicated globally with structured steps including targeting, asset transfer, consumption support (typically cash), training, and monitoring, aiming for graduation from extreme poverty—instead, TPA utilizes diversified measures tailored to household needs, such as employment, education, healthcare, relocation, and different types of subsidies.[1][2][3][4][5][8] Evidence strongly indicates TPA includes cash transfer components; examples include direct financial subsidies to poor households for participation in training, employment, and incremental income rewards, analogous to income support or cash transfers.[3] There is mention of material support and relocation, but reliable, detailed evidence that the program systematically provides productive assets (such as livestock, tools, or start-up capital) to ultra-poor, as graduation programs do, is lacking or ambiguous in available literature.[1][2][3] The program's official English name is Targeted Poverty Alleviation (Jingzhun fupin). | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://www.china-ces.org/Files/3058abstract/202412170201434113.pdf, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/05/Xie_Presentation-Lunyu-XIE1.pdf",
