  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Innovation Pole of the Great North (PIGraN)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: PIGraN (Pôle d’Innovation du Grand Nord) is led by GRAHN-World and primarily functions as an academic and innovation hub centered on graduate education and regional economic development via ISTEAH, rather than as a targeted multi-component poverty or graduation program. The available sources—including official presentations and descriptions—highlight PIGraN as a campus and 'City of Knowledge' aiming for wealth and job creation in Northern Haiti by fostering an ecosystem connecting education, science, technology, and entrepreneurship[1][4]. There is no evidence in authoritative project descriptions or sectoral analyses that PIGraN directly provides cash transfers, stipends, or productive assets to ultra-poor or extreme poor individuals as a graduation-type intervention. Instead, it focuses on higher education, research, and business incubation, distinctly different from poverty graduation approaches implemented in Haiti by organizations like Fonkoze or Beyond Borders, which do provide such support[3][7]. No project or evaluation mentions cash transfer or asset distribution components for PIGraN. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://naahpusa.org/conferences/2015/presentation-of-grahn-worlds-innovation-pole-of-the-greater-north-of-haiti-pigran-the-city-of-knowledge/, https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09713557231201181, https://beyondborders.net/the-graduation-model-a-sustainable-way-out-of-extreme-poverty/",
