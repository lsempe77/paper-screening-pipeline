The program includes various targeted measures, such as relocation, healthcare, education, industrial development, and employment support[1][3][4]. Evidence shows that the TPA deployed cash-based support mechanisms, including direct subsidies (such as subsidies for training and performance rewards)[3], and policies guaranteeing minimum living standards (which include cash transfers or subsidies)[4]. The program also provided productive assets by enabling poor households to participate in industrial development projects (e.g., agriculture, local enterprises), gain employment, and receive relocation to new housing – all forms of material or asset-based support[4]. However, the graduation model is typically defined by a sequence of timed interventions (often cash, assets, and training) intending to permanently lift ultra-poor households out of poverty, as exemplified by the BRAC or IPA models. While TPA is intensive, tailored, and comprehensive, authoritative sources do not categorize it as a 'graduation program' in the technical sense prevalent in development literature; rather, it is a multi-component government poverty alleviation campaign. Thus, it is not generally considered a graduation program but is a multi-component anti-poverty program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://www.china-ces.org/Files/3058abstract/202412170201434113.pdf, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/05/Xie_Presentation-Lunyu-XIE1.pdf",
