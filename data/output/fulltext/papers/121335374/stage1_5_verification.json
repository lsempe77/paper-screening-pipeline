  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Rubble removal project' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The 'Rubble removal project' in Gaza, also referred to as the 'Gaza Emergency Removal and Crushing of Rubble and Debris Management Project,' is primarily an infrastructure and emergency relief initiative implemented by the UNDP with funding from USAID and other donors[1][3][4]. Its core objective is to clear debris from war-damaged areas, restore essential services, and facilitate reconstruction. The project does create short-term employment opportunities as part of the debris removal operation, but there is no evidence in the available sources that it operates as a graduation program or multi-component anti-poverty initiative in the sense used by organizations like BRAC or IPA. Graduation programs typically target ultra-poor households with a coordinated package of cash transfers, productive asset grants, skills training, and coaching towards sustainable livelihoods. There is no information indicating that the project components include direct cash transfers to ultra-poor households or the distribution of productive assets such as livestock, inputs, or tools for livelihoods. Job creation is incidental to the infrastructure work, not part of a targeted poverty graduation intervention. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/82769, https://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_file.cfm?doc_id=284701, https://www.un.org/unispal/document-source/undp-programme-of-assistance-to-the-palestinian-people-papp/page/7/",
