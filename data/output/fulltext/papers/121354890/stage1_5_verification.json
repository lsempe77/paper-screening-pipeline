  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Land Consolidation (LC) Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Land Consolidation Program in China primarily aims at rural revitalization by reorganizing and improving farmland, upgrading infrastructure, and increasing agricultural efficiency. Evidence from research indicates LC's main impacts are on boosting rural development, farmers' income, and poverty alleviation, mainly through physical and productive asset interventions such as land improvement and infrastructure[5][6]. There is no credible evidence indicating LC provides direct cash transfers or stipends; instead, the focus is on land and ecological resources and productive assets. Most references describe LC as an asset-based intervention, not a multi-component graduation program akin to the BRAC model, which would include both cash and assets, plus coaching. LC serves as a rural development policy, not a targeted ultra-poor graduation program. Some broader poverty programs in China might provide cash or direct support, but the LC Program itself does not. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019LUPol..82..339Z/abstract, https://www.geogsci.com/EN/10.1007/s11442-019-1599-9",
