  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'China Poverty Reduction Policy (PRP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The term 'China Poverty Reduction Policy (PRP)' is not an official program name found in authoritative sources. Instead, the widely recognized initiative matching this description is the '8-7 Poverty Reduction Program,' launched in the mid-1990s. This program set a national goal to eradicate absolute poverty by the year 2000, predominantly through a combination of targeted investments, preferential financial and monetary policies, expansion of social services (education and health), and significant support for productive economic activities. There is substantial evidence that asset building—investment in land, agricultural inputs, infrastructure, and rural industries—was central to the 8-7 Program. However, there is no clear evidence that the program provided direct cash transfers or stipends to recipients as a core intervention; instead, the support was largely in-kind or project-based (e.g., subsidized loans or grants for productive projects). Furthermore, the 'graduation approach' is a specific multi-component anti-poverty model developed by BRAC and evaluated in other contexts, which combines assets, cash stipends, training, and coaching. While China's policies were multi-sectoral, there is no evidence that they conform to the strict criteria of a graduation program as described in international literature (which requires sequenced, integrated cash, assets, and training). Cash transfers might have occurred indirectly via pensions or social assistance for the rural poor in later years, but these were not foundational to the 8-7 Program's architecture. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents/ameizhang_0.pdf, https://f3.xhinst.net/group2/M00/00/B5/CgoMnmhvj-uEJnwkAAAAADfZqz0700.pdf, https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/bdadc16a4f5c1c88a839c0f905cde802-0070012022/original/Poverty-Synthesis-Report-final.pdf",
