  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Community Empowerment Program (CEP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Community Empowerment Program in Jordan, officially called the Jordan River Community Empowerment Program (JRCEP), is a long-standing initiative focused on economic empowerment, entrepreneurship, and workforce readiness for vulnerable Jordanians and refugees. It offers training, microenterprise support, and improved access to financial resources. However, there is no evidence that JRCEP directly follows the 'graduation' model as defined in global practice (which requires time-bound, holistic, sequenced interventions including consumption support, cash transfers, productive asset provision, and coaching)[1][2][4][7][8]. While the program provides grants in some project examples and promotes access to financial tools, there is no explicit documentation of unconditional or regular cash transfers, or the provision of productive assets typical of graduation programs. The only mention of grants is in the context of supporting entrepreneurial activities, which may or may not be equivalent to productive asset provision as defined in graduation programs[4]. No credible sources indicate the regular disbursement of cash stipends or productive asset transfers, and 'cash component' and 'asset component' details are not specifically outlined. Therefore, while JRCEP addresses poverty and empowerment, it lacks evidence of being a graduation program with cash and productive asset components. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: MEDIUM | Sources: https://www.jordanriver.jo/en/programs/community-empowerment-program, https://olbios.org/giving-vulnerable-people-tools-for-empowerment/, https://dsp-me.org/media/1clf04e1/barriers-and-opportunities-graduation-jordan03.pdf",
