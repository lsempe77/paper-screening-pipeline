It is not designed as a multi-component 'graduation' program (such as those pioneered by BRAC or J-PAL) targeting the ultra-poor by combining cash, assets, training, and other supports. Instead, ASA primarily offers microloans (credit) which beneficiaries use to invest directly in productive assets (e.g., purchasing livestock or equipment for small business)[1]. There is no evidence that the program gives unconditional or regular cash transfers or stipends; all financial support is in the form of loans that require repayment[1][3][5]. While ASA's credit allows the poor to acquire productive assets, the model does not encompass the broader package of interventions found in graduation programs (such as BRAC's Targeting the Ultra Poor or Trickle Up). | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://thescipub.com/pdf/ajabssp.2020.51.59.pdf, https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstreams/4aa3d208-170a-57e1-a5db-d9e820f7a628/download, https://asa.org.bd",
