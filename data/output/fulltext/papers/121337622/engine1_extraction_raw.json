The program provides loans/credit rather than cash transfers or productive assets. I've marked both Component A and B as false since this is not a graduation-style program with direct cash support or asset transfers.\n\nThe study examines differences between microfinance members and non-members across various economic outcomes, but does not describe any direct provision of cash or assets as part of the program intervention."
