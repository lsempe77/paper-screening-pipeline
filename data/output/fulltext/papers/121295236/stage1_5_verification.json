  "assessment": "UNCLEAR",
  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Multiple interventions comparison study (agricultural extension, subsidized agricultural inputs, poultry transfers)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The search identified a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a graduation program in northern Kenya implemented by the BOMA Project and evaluated by researchers including Carter, Jensen, Krovetz, and Zheng[1]. This graduation program is modeled on BRAC's Targeting the Ultra Poor approach and aims to build both tangible productive assets (such as livestock or poultry) and intangible assets (like entrepreneurial skills and psychosocial capabilities)[1]. The program significantly increased beneficiaries’ holdings of productive assets, family cash income, and financial savings. The results report a 414% increase in productive assets and a 500% increase in financial savings after 24 months[1]. However, while increased cash income and financial savings were measured outcomes, direct evidence of cash transfer or stipends as a component of the program is not clearly stated in the available summary[1][6][7]. The program is multi-component, targets ultra-poor women, and fits the definition of a graduation program. The interventions described—productive asset transfers (such as livestock/poultry), training, and support—match those listed in the user's query. The sources do not explicitly describe unconditional or regular cash transfers as a standalone component but do confirm asset transfer. | Graduation: YES, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31611/w31611.pdf, https://poverty-action.org/evaluating-environmentally-focused-ultra-poor-graduation-program-kenya, https://basis.ucdavis.edu/project/randomized-evaluation-integrated-graduation-and-contingent-social-protection-program-kenya",
