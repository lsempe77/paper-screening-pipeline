  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Familias en Acción (FA)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Familias en Acción is Colombia’s largest social protection program and is well-documented as a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program targeting poor and extreme poor households with children. Its primary mechanisms are cash incentives (subsidies) for meeting health and education co-responsibilities. Multiple sources—including government documents and independent evaluations—support that it operates through cash incentives and does not include a component delivering productive assets such as livestock, tools, or seed capital, which are hallmarks of graduation programs. While there is discussion of 'graduation' in the sense of exiting the program or achieving increased welfare, the program itself is not an integrated graduation model as exemplified by BRAC. There is also no evidence in the cited sources that FA directly involves components of productive asset transfers. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://dps2018.prosperidadsocial.gov.co/covid19/Paginas/Familias.aspx, https://colaboracion.dnp.gov.co/CDT/Sinergia/Documentos/393_Impactos_de_Largo_Plazo_en_el_Programa_Familias_en_Accion_DOC.pdf, https://es.slideshare.net/slideshow/colombia-43910432/43910432",
