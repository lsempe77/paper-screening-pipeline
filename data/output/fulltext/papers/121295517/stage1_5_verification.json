  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Whole Village Poverty Alleviation Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The search results do not reference an official 'Whole Village Poverty Alleviation Program' as a distinct nationwide program, but the terminology and described interventions fit China's 'Targeted Poverty Alleviation' strategy. This approach has been applied to whole villages (such as Shibadong and Minning), resulting in poverty 'graduation.' These programs are multi-component and include industrial development, household-targeted measures, relocation, and infrastructure. Evidence from Shibadong (cited as a model) shows productive asset provision through industry development, tailored poverty alleviation to each household, and substantial increases in per-capita income[2]. Relocation programs provided assets (housing), infrastructure, and employment opportunities[3]. There is confirmed provision of cash components through subsidies for living and education expenses[3], and other forms of social assistance and cash transfer programs have grown with improved targeting[4]. However, while villages are declared to 'graduate from poverty,' these programs are not strictly modeled on the international 'graduation approach' typified by BRAC or J-PAL (which combines sequencing of cash, training, assets, and wraparound services for the ultra-poor). The label 'graduation program' is thus ambiguous. Still, the program clearly involves cash transfers/subsidies and productive asset provision. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: MEDIUM | Sources: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/zy/jj/zggcddwjw100ggs/xsd/202406/t20240606_11378010.html, https://en.people.cn/n3/2022/1111/c90000-10170214.html, https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fapp.20160079",
