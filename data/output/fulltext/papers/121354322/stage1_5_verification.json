  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'South Asia Poverty Alleviation Programme (SAPAP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: SAPAP was launched as a UNDP pilot project to tackle rural poverty in South Asia, including India, notably in Andhra Pradesh. The core feature was the community-driven model for social mobilization, group formation, capacity building, and livelihood improvement, focusing on empowering extremely poor women to move out of poverty—a hallmark of graduation and multi-component approaches. SAPAP's Indian pilots inspired later scaled-up graduation-style rural livelihood programs, such as SERP and NRLM. While sources highlight economic empowerment, social mobilization, and the establishment of microcredit and savings groups as activities, none of the reviewed references explicitly confirm individual cash transfer/stipend or direct productive asset provision at the SAPAP pilot phase. Some sources mention microcredit and economic support, which may imply financial or asset components, but the available documents do not provide sufficient detail. Therefore, SAPAP fits the graduation/multi-component poverty program model but lacks explicit evidence of the specific components requested. | Graduation: YES, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: MEDIUM | Sources: https://rspn.org/work/regional-cooperation/, https://erc.undp.org/evaluation/documents/download/5019, https://www.un.org/esa/coordination/Statement.ShoaibSultanKhan.pdf",
