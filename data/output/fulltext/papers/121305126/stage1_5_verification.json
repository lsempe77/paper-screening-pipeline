There is clear documentation of lump-sum cash transfers to ex-combatants: for example, monthly stipends and lump sums of up to 600,000 Burundian Francs (~$600) per person were reported, plus in some cases a bicycle to enhance mobility[1][2][3]. Studies note that these cash payments were used largely for immediate consumption, leading to a temporary boost in local economies[2][3]. Additionally, some ex-combatants used grants to purchase productive assets such as cattle and land, particularly in rural areas—though such asset acquisition was not universal, especially for those lacking land or networks[1][5]. However, the program cannot be classified as a 'graduation' or ultra poor-focused multi-component program in the sense of the BRAC/J-PAL/IPA model: it did not combine regular cash support with a sequenced package of asset transfers, intensive training, and ongoing social support specifically targeting extreme poverty. The DRR’s primary objective was post-conflict stabilization rather than poverty graduation, and evidence suggests that longer-term livelihood improvement was mixed: short-term gains faded over time for many[2][3][7]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://academic.oup.com/wber/article-abstract/32/2/357/2669665, https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstreams/ac52fd15-a5ff-5733-8017-5ff698893ca7/download, https://www.clingendael.org/sites/default/files/2016-02/20090318_cru_reintegration_burundi_specker.pdf",
