Its primary focus is on upgrading infrastructure, improving public services, and enhancing livelihoods and productivity through interventions at the community level[2][9]. The program supports productive assets such as investments in rural transportation, schools, irrigation, and water supply systems, mainly through local government-managed capital spending[2]. While poverty reduction is a goal, there is no evidence in recent or past program documentation or evaluations that the NRD provides direct cash transfers or stipends to households, nor is it structured as a graduation program (which would typically include sequenced asset transfers, cash, training, and intensive case management to enable the ultra-poor to 'graduate' out of poverty)[2][3][5]. The NRD's approach is collective, infrastructural, and not targeted towards ultra-poor households individually—with beneficiary communities sometimes contributing their own resources and labor[4]. A graduation approach is not referenced by any international evaluation or rural poverty expert sources (e.g., World Bank, UN, academic studies), and the program is not associated with individual-level cash assistance, though some credit and housing support may be present in parallel government initiatives[7]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/en/topics/poverty-policy-and-regulation/, https://vietnam.un.org/sites/default/files/2021-12/NTP%20NRD%20Summary%20ENG.pdf, https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/975721498874530249/vietnam-national-targeted-programs-for-new-rural-development-and-sustainable-poverty-reduction-support-program-ntpsp-program-for-results-project",
