  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Village Alive Development Initiative (VADI)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Available sources consistently describe VADI as a rural poverty alleviation initiative run by the Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute (ARMTI) in Nigeria. The program aims to enhance livelihoods by supporting community-based organizations, expanding livelihood opportunities, providing agricultural inputs, extension services, and facilitating access to credit for rural households[1][2][3][5][6]. There is no direct evidence that VADI is modeled after the 'graduation' approach (as defined by BRAC, J-PAL, IPA, or the World Bank) which typically requires a sequenced combination of consumption support (often cash/in-kind transfers), training, asset transfers, financial inclusion, and follow-up[9]. VADI focuses more on enterprise development, agricultural training, facilitating access to loans, and occasionally providing inputs or advisory support—rather than direct productive asset transfers or guaranteed cash stipends[1][2][3][4]. Multiple impact assessments highlight improved income and credit access as outcomes, but do not report systematic delivery of cash or assets as program components; support is primarily through training, facilitating loans, and improving agricultural or business practices. Some beneficiaries use loans for their own business investment, but this is credit, not a transfer[1][3][4][5]. There is no documentation confirming that VADI provides productive asset grants or direct cash transfers as a central and guaranteed component. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://hortson.org.ng/images/Journals/2022volume/Ajibade_2022_compressed.pdf, https://adanjournal.org.ng/index.php/adanj/article/download/63/59/111, https://www.gajrc.com/media/articles/GAJAB_53_47-60.pdf",
