  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: LEAP is Ghana's flagship social protection program. Its core intervention is the provision of regular unconditional or mildly conditional cash transfers and free health insurance to extremely poor households. Multiple sources, including the official government site and several impact evaluations, confirm the cash transfer and health insurance components as the primary benefits. There is no evidence that LEAP provides productive assets (such as livestock, capital equipment, or startup funds for livelihoods)—no reports or program documents describe an assets transfer component, which is central to 'graduation' programs. The program is not designed as a multi-component 'graduation' model like the BRAC Ultra Poor Graduation approach; instead, it is a standard unconditional or mildly conditional cash transfer, not including asset transfers, skills/livelihood training, or intensive coaching that characterize graduation programs. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/ghana/, https://leap.mogcsp.gov.gh/, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a089ad40f0b649740001f2/LEAP_Impact_Evaluation_FINAL2014march17.pdf",
