  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: LEAP is Ghana's flagship social protection program targeting extremely poor households, especially those with elderly, disabled, or orphaned/vulnerable children. Multiple sources, including government and major evaluations, explicitly state that LEAP is a social cash transfer program, providing regular cash grants and free health insurance to beneficiaries. There is no credible evidence that the LEAP program includes the direct provision of productive assets as part of its standard intervention package. LEAP is not structured as a 'graduation' or multi-component (e.g., cash plus asset plus training) program in the way of BRAC's Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP) or similar models—it focuses on income support and human capital (e.g., school attendance, health insurance), but not direct asset transfers or time-bound graduation strategies. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/ghana/, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a089ad40f0b649740001f2/LEAP_Impact_Evaluation_FINAL2014march17.pdf, https://leap.mogcsp.gov.gh/1143-2/",
