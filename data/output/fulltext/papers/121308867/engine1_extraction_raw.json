The program focused on broader rural development across multiple domains including health, infrastructure, education, income, culture, environment, and security. While it measured impacts on income and poverty reduction, there is no evidence in the text of direct cash transfers or asset transfers to households, so both Component A and B are marked as false.\n\nThe study used a quasi-experimental design comparing communes that fully implemented the program (\"new rural communes\") versus those that only partially implemented it. The sample size of 1,633 households is mentioned in the propensity score matching analysis."
