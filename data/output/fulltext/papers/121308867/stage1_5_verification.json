Its primary interventions are upgrading infrastructure, vocational training, and agricultural modernization. There is no evidence in government documents, peer-reviewed studies, or World Bank evaluations indicating that the core program includes regular cash transfers or provides productive assets directly to targeted poor households, nor that it is designed as a graduation-type program (which typically involves time-bound cash/asset transfers combined with intensive livelihood and training support for the ultra-poor). Instead, the program focuses on communal improvements and capacity-building at the local level, not household-level cash or asset support. While poverty alleviation is one goal, the program is implemented at the community scale and is not a targeted graduation intervention like the BRAC model. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.baochinhphu.vn/national-target-program-on-new-style-rural-area-building-for-2021-2025-approved-111220302153824447.htm, https://www.questjournals.org/jrees/papers/vol10-issue12/10128393.pdf, https://en.vietnamplus.vn/vietnam-global-model-for-poverty-alleviation-rural-development-post331670.vnp",
