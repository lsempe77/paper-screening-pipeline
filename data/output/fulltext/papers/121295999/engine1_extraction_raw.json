While it's described as an \"integrated nutrition program,\" there is no evidence in the provided text of either cash transfers/consumption support or productive asset transfers. The program seems focused on nutrition education, rehabilitation, and hygiene practices.\n\nThe study is a randomized controlled trial examining health outcomes (specifically respiratory infections and diarrhea) among young children. The sample size includes 119 children per group (238 total), and the study was conducted in northern Vietnam during the 1990s."
