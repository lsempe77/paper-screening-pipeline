  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Save the Children's integrated nutrition program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The available sources describe Save the Children's integrated nutrition program in Vietnam as focused on improving child nutrition through community-based interventions, education, improved hygiene, maternal training, and infrastructure such as nutrition gardens and upgraded school facilities. These interventions include nutrition education, training on food preparation, and the establishment of local food gardens for school and community use. There is no mention of unconditional or conditional cash transfers, stipends, or provision of productive assets (such as livestock, agricultural equipment, or cash earmarked for income-generating activities). Nor is there reference to a structured 'graduation' approach, commonly defined as a timed, sequenced package combining cash or asset provision, skills training, mentoring, and access to services with the explicit goal of transitioning ultra-poor households out of extreme poverty, in the style of programs tested by BRAC, IPA, J-PAL, or the World Bank. The evaluated intervention is an integrated nutrition program, not a poverty graduation or multi-component livelihood support package involving cash or assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12503234/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12503232/, https://vietnamtimes.thoidai.com.vn/save-the-children-supporting-youth-from-nutrition-to-education-82234.html",
