While it does provide cash subsidies to participants—these are direct payments and in-kind compensation (such as grain) for converting cropland—this is a hallmark of PES but not equivalent to the multi-component support (such as skills training, intensive case management, and asset transfer) typical of graduation programs like BRAC's Targeting the Ultra Poor. Research reviews and government reports explicitly detail a 'cash subsidy' for eligible farming households[3]. Evidence for the direct provision of productive assets (such as livestock or business equipment) is ambiguous: households may plant trees or shift production, but explicit asset transfer in the graduation sense is not observed in program descriptions or evaluations. Thus, the program is not considered a graduation program, it does provide cash transfers, and the asset transfer component is unclear. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3093530/, https://www.cbd.int/financial/pes/china-pessloping.pdf, http://www.ccap.pku.edu.cn/docs/2018-04/20180408135720384976.pdf",
