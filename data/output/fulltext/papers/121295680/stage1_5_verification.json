  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Alive & Thrive (A&T) intensive intervention' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Based on the available sources, the Alive & Thrive (A&T) intensive intervention in Ethiopia focuses on improving maternal, child, and adolescent nutrition through large-scale social and behavior change communication, capacity building, policy advocacy, and integration of nutrition services within health and agriculture sectors[2][4][6][7][9]. There is no evidence that Alive & Thrive Ethiopia is designed as a graduation model poverty alleviation program (such as those following the BRAC or J-PAL graduation approach), nor does it directly provide cash transfers, stipends, or productive asset grants to ultra-poor or extremely poor households. Related studies that mention graduation programs and cash or asset transfers in Ethiopia refer to other programs, such as the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), and do not identify Alive & Thrive as the implementing or core program for those components[3][8]. Therefore, Alive & Thrive is a multi-component nutrition and behavior-change program, but not a graduation program and does not have direct cash or asset transfer components. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.aliveandthrive.org/en/where-we-work/ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/project/alive-and-thrive/, https://essp.ifpri.info/2025/10/29/scalable-nutrition-interventions-in-a-graduation-model-program-experimental-evidence-from-ethiopia/",
