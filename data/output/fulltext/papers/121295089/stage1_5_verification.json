  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Transfer Payment Policy of National Key Ecological Functional Areas (TPEFAP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Transfer Payment Policy of National Key Ecological Functional Areas (TPEFAP) is a fiscal transfer program in China that allocates funds to provincial and local governments to incentivize and compensate for ecological protection in national key ecological functional areas. This program is distinct from China's Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program, which is a multi-component poverty intervention involving tailored household and community support, cash transfers, and productive assets.[1][3][4] TPEFAP provides cash fiscal transfers, not direct cash transfers to households for poverty reduction, and does not target ultra-poor populations with graduation-style interventions nor provide productive assets directly to households. The program's cash component refers to transfers to local governments intended for ecological protection and not livelihoods or asset provision for poor households. There is no evidence from official sources, program evaluations, or academic literature that TPEFAP qualifies as a graduation program or includes an assets component.[1][3][4] | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://voxchina.org/show-3-391.html, https://thetricontinental.org/studies-1-socialist-construction/, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/05/Xie_Presentation-Lunyu-XIE1.pdf",
