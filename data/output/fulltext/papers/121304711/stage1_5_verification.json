  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Working for Water (WfW)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Working for Water (WfW) in South Africa is a large-scale public works programme focused on creating jobs through the removal of invasive plant species. While it provides employment to marginalized groups, including women, youth, and individuals with disabilities, the structure is not consistent with the graduation approach as defined by programs like BRAC, IPA, or the World Bank, which typically involve an integrated sequence of cash transfers, productive asset grants, training, and intensive coaching for the ultra-poor. WfW offers temporary jobs, education, and training, as well as social support services. There is no evidence of unconditional or conditional cash transfers (outside of wages for labor), nor of the provision of productive assets such as livestock, inventory, or tools for the purpose of kickstarting household enterprises among the ultra-poor. The main benefit is paid labor related to environmental management, not livelihood graduation or asset transfers. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.greeneconomycoalition.org/news-and-resources/working-for-water-in-south-africa, https://www.dws.gov.za/wfw/, https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/esploro/outputs/graduate/South-Africas-Working-for-Water-Programme/9926478427201891",
