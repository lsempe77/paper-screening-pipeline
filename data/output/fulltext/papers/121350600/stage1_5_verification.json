  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Three-stage poverty alleviation projects (World Bank-China collaboration)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The World Bank-China poverty alleviation projects—including the Sustainable Development in Poor Rural Areas Project—are multi-component rural development programs that primarily focus on enhancing infrastructure (such as roads, water, and electricity), supporting agricultural development, and offering vocational training. These are rooted in a community-driven development model and align with China's broader area-based poverty alleviation strategy. Unlike classic 'graduation' programs (such as BRAC's Targeting the Ultra Poor) which systematically combine time-bound cash transfers, asset transfers, training, and coaching, there is no evidence that these Chinese projects integrated all graduation components in a bundled, time-bound manner. The evidence clearly shows support for 'productive assets' such as land improvements, infrastructure, water, and agricultural investments. While increased income is an outcome, direct evidence of systematic individual or household-level cash transfers or stipends as in graduation models is not found in available documentation. The approach is thus multi-dimensional and area-focused, but not a pure graduation program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2010/10/20/world-bank-support-china-exploring-innovative-approaches-poverty-reduction, https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2013/04/09/china-poverty-alleviation-through-community-participation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation",
