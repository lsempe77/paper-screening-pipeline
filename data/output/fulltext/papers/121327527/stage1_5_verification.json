  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Funds to Combat Poverty (FCP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Funds to Combat Poverty (FCP) in Brazil is a constitutionally created fiscal fund to finance anti-poverty actions at the state level, especially supporting cash transfer programs like Bolsa Família (which later became Auxílio Brasil). It is not itself a 'graduation' program—a multi-component, time-bound model like the CGAP-Ford Foundation Graduation Program focused on the ultra-poor. Rather, FCP provides funding for various poverty reduction interventions, mostly centered on direct cash transfers to families in poverty, with some states using the funds for other forms of social assistance or infrastructure. There is no evidence that the FCP itself runs productive asset transfers (such as livestock, tools, or grants for business capital) typical of graduation programs. While Brazil has experimented with integrated approaches, the FCP's primary mechanism remains cash transfer funding. The most widely cited program funded by FCP is Bolsa Família, a classic conditional cash transfer program, not a graduation/livelihood program. No sources confirm FCP provides productive assets directly, and none describe a sequenced intervention with asset transfer, training, and coaching as per the graduation model. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.sdg16.plus/policies/bolsa-famlia-is-brazils-largest-conditional-cash-transfer-program-seeking-to-break-intergenerational-poverty/, https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/11/05/opinion/letters/brazils-proven-framework-for-achieving-sustained-poverty-reduction/, https://apolitical.co/solution-articles/en/brazil-lifts-millions-poverty-direct-cash-transfer-scheme",
