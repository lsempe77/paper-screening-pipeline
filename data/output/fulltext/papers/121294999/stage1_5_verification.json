  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'China's poverty alleviation policy' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: China's poverty alleviation policy, officially implemented as the Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) programme, is a large multi-component poverty intervention rather than a graduation program structured on the BRAC or J-PAL model. TPA deploys a mix of interventions: (1) cash components are evident with documented direct subsidies and stipends to poor families, training subsidies for employment, rewards for income generation, and nutrition assistance. (2) Productive assets and supports are core—interventions include relocation to new housing, vocational training, creation of public jobs, and support for entrepreneurship and agricultural productivity, among others. These fit a multidimensional approach rather than the classical time-bound 'graduation' structure. The program is not exclusively targeted at the ultra-poor using a set sequence of asset transfer, coaching, and cash stipends but instead flexibly combines cash, assets, education, healthcare, and institutional support for broad poverty relief and sustainable livelihood. Multiple sources—including UNDP, World Bank, Stanford, and official PRC documents—substantiate the cash and asset components, but none characterize TPA as a graduation program in the mold of BRAC/J-PAL/IPA. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://thetricontinental.org/studies-1-socialist-construction/, https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents/ameizhang_0.pdf, https://pk.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/zt/2356800/202104/P020210911658013307874.pdf",
