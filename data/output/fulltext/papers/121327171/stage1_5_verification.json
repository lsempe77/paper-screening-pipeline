  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Soil conservation program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The most relevant program matching the description is the Environmental Program of El Salvador (PAES), which included a significant soil conservation and agroforestry component. This program targeted poor rural households, especially smallholder farmers below the poverty line, and aimed to improve livelihoods by promoting conservation technologies and boosting soil productivity. PAES provided capacity-building, technical support, and access to resources such as soil protection crops, reforestation, and agricultural equipment. However, there is no direct evidence that PAES or comparable soil conservation programs in El Salvador included direct cash transfers or stipends. The description focuses on natural asset support and technical assistance rather than multi-component interventions like those typical of 'graduation' programs, which integrate cash, asset, and training components to move the ultra-poor permanently out of poverty. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Adoption-of-Soil-Conservation-Technologies-in-El-Salvador-A-Cross-Section-and-Over-Time-Analysis.pdf, https://opecfund.org/news/el-salvador-promising-a-square-meal-for-all, https://prismaregional.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Rural_poverty_and_the_environment_ESV.pdf",
