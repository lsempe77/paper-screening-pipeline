  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Social Assistance Programs (SAPs) Review' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: There is no specific evidence of a program officially named 'Social Assistance Programs (SAPs) Review' operating as a graduation or multi-component poverty program across multiple LMICs. The closest relevant evidence is general reviews of social assistance (e.g., social grants, cash transfers, and livelihood interventions) in LMICs, but these are not unified under a single program with that title. Graduation programs in LMICs, such as those described by the World Bank and BRAC, typically combine cash transfers and productive asset provision, but the 'SAPs Review' name does not appear in authoritative sources as a specific program. Therefore, we cannot confirm if this is a graduation program, or if it provides cash and productive assets, or its official name, based on currently available sources. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: LOW | Sources: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/238611633430611402/south-africa-social-assistance-programs-and-systems-review, https://capacity4dev.europa.eu/articles/graduation-social-protection-what-it-means-how-it-works_en, https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2013/04/04/graduation-program-creating-pathways-out-of-extreme-poverty-into-sustainable-livelihoods",
