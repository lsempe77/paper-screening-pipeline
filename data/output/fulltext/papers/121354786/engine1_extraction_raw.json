This appears to be a secondary analysis of survey data rather than an evaluation of a specific cash transfer or productive asset program.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"paper_metadata\": {\n    \"title\": \"Work Hour Volatility and Child Poverty: The Role of the Safety Net\",\n    \"matches_expected_title\": \"NO\"\n  },\n  \"program_information\": {\n    \"program_name\": \"Not a program evaluation - analysis of SIPP survey data\",\n    \"country\": \"United States\",\n    \"region\": \"National\",\n    \"target_population\": \"Households with children under 18\"\n  },\n  \"intervention_components\": {\n    \"component_a_cash_support\": {\n      \"component_a_present\": false,\n      \"cash_support_type\": null,\n      \"cash_amount\": null,\n      \"cash_frequency\": null,\n      \"is_loan_or_credit\": \"NO\",\n      \"cash_evidence_citation\": \"This is not an intervention study - analyzes existing safety net programs like TANF, UI, and tax credits\"\n    },\n    \"component_b_assets\": {\n      \"component_b_present\": false,\n      \"assets_provided\": [],\n      \"direct_provision\": \"NO\",\n      \"assets_evidence_citation\": \"This is not an intervention study - no assets were provided\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"study_characteristics\": {\n    \"outcomes_measured\": [\"poverty\", \"income\", \"work hours volatility\"],\n    \"outcomes_evidence_citation\": \"Results indicate that more than one in four households (26%) facing the greatest volatility lived under the poverty line\",\n    \"study_design\": \"Observational analysis of survey data\",\n    \"design_evidence_citation\": \"The study uses data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), a nationally representative data set well known for its comprehensive information on household income, earnings, program participation, and socio-economic status\",\n    \"is_review_or_policy_analysis\": true,\n    \"publication_year\": null,\n    \"study_conducted_year\": \"2004-2019\",\n    \"sample_size\": 103501,\n    \"completed\": true\n  },\n  \"bonus_information\": {\n    \"has_qualitative_components\": false,\n    \"qualitative_methods\": [],\n    \"qualitative_evidence_citation\": null,\n    \"has_cost_data\": false,\n    \"cost_mentions\": null,\n    \"cost_evidence_citation\": null\n  },\n  \"evidence_citations\": {\n    \"program_name_citation\": \"The study uses data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), a nationally representative data set\",\n    \"country_citation\": \"Real GDP per capita increased by over 15 percent between early 2000 and 2016 in the United States\",\n    \"target_population_citation\": \"Adopting a child-focused perspective, the study restricts the sample to households in which a child lives\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: This paper is not evaluating a specific cash transfer or productive asset program - it's analyzing survey data to understand how work hour volatility relates to child poverty and how existing safety net programs respond. Therefore, I've marked both intervention components as false since this is not an intervention study."
