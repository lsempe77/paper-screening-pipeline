  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Not a program evaluation - analysis of SIPP survey data' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The entry 'Not a program evaluation - analysis of SIPP survey data' does not refer to a social protection program but rather to an analysis conducted using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) dataset. SIPP is a longitudinal survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau and designed to collect detailed information on income, program participation, cash and noncash benefits, and assets among U.S. households. It is not itself a graduation or multi-component poverty program, nor does it directly provide cash transfers or productive assets to participants. SIPP collects data about various transfer programs and asset ownership but is a data collection effort, not a provider of social assistance or productive assets. There is no evidence that analyzing SIPP data constitutes a poverty intervention or that SIPP itself delivers benefits.[1][2][4][5] | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/series/135, https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/RCMD/series/135/publications, https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp.html",
