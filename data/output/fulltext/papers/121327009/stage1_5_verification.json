  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Bridges to Success (BtS)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Extensive review of all accessible sources, including those specifically focused on poverty reduction, ultra-poor graduation, cash transfers, and asset provision, yielded no evidence that 'Bridges to Success (BtS)' in the United States is a graduation or multi-component poverty program in the technical sense used by organizations like BRAC, J-PAL, IPA, or the World Bank. The most prominent U.S. programs using this name (run by United Way of Central Iowa and others) focus primarily on education support, coaching, high school equivalency completion, and career readiness. None describe direct cash transfers, stipends, or provision of productive assets to participants. The focus is on coaching, educational opportunity, and community engagement, not on asset transfer, cash grants, or holistic livelihood interventions for the ultra-poor. No connection to BRAC-style graduation programming or ultra-poverty graduation pilots in the U.S. is documented. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.unitedwaydm.org/news/bridges-to-success-report-to-the-community, https://www.campbellsville.edu/campus-life/office-of-community-and-access/bridge-to-success-bts.html, https://as.richmond.edu/initiatives-resources/bridge.html",
