Multiple authoritative sources explicitly describe PATH as a conditional cash transfer program—its primary benefit is the provision of regular monetary support to eligible families[1][2][3][4][5][6][9]. PATH supports skills development and work training through the linked 'Steps-to-Work' program, but the core PATH program itself does not transfer productive assets directly (such as livestock, business inventory, or equipment typical of graduation/livelihood programs like BRAC's), nor does it fulfill the multi-component asset-based assistance typical of formal graduation programs. It is not designed as a graduation or ultra-poor livelihood program, but rather as a social safety net relying on cash transfers and education/health conditionalities[2][3][4][6]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.mlss.gov.jm/features/path/, https://www.serenityresourceconnector.com/post/path-jamaica-a-step-by-step-guide-to-benefits-eligibility-and-life-changing-impact, https://dds.cepal.org/bpsnc/programme?id=21",
