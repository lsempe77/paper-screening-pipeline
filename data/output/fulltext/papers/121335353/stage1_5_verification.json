Its key interventions are the improvement of basic infrastructure, promotion of agricultural production, and enhancement of access to education and health services, along with capacity building for local officials and communities[1][2][3][5]. The program addresses poverty through investments in productive assets and infrastructure (e.g., irrigation systems, roads, clinics, schools), yet there is no clear and direct evidence in available sources confirming regular direct cash transfer or stipend components. Some reports mention financial support for school boarders and pro-poor budgeting, but these are not described as broad household cash transfers[1]. The program is not classified as a graduation-style intervention (which typically bundles cash, asset transfer, coaching, and financial inclusion in a sequenced model to reach sustainable livelihoods) as seen in BRAC or similar models; instead, it is a government-led integrated area development program focusing on infrastructure, productive assets and services, but not on sequenced graduation methodology[2][3][5]. Support for productive assets is clear, as the program heavily invests in agriculture, housing, and clean water facilities for poor households. However, details on specific asset-cash links and individual household targeting are not detailed in the references. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/egms/docs/2009/Ghana/Quan.pdf, https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/267818/1/1807865177.pdf, https://mdri.org.vn/publications/programme-135-addressing-poverty-and-inequality-in-viet-nam/",
