These schemes are part of a broader ecological poverty-relief strategy, designed to offer regular wages as compensation for environmental conservation work, not as unconditional cash transfers or productive asset provision. Multiple sources confirm the cash-based wage component, but there is no credible evidence that EPWP-type programs provide direct transfers of productive assets such as livestock, tools, or business capital to participants, nor do they offer the intensive, time-bound livelihood support package characteristic of graduation programs (e.g., BRAC model). EPWP is an employment-based safety net and ecological compensation initiative, not a multi-component graduation intervention. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://lapost.us/?p=32015, https://en.people.cn/n3/2020/1201/c90000-9794560.html, https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/892656/eawp-065-ecological-protection-prc-case-studies.pdf",
