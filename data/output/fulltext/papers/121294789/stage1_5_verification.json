  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'National Poor Counties (NPCs) program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The so-called 'National Poor Counties (NPCs) program' is referenced in English academic and policy literature as the 'National Key Poor Counties program', also integrated into the larger Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program, which began in 2014. This program identified 592 counties as nationally-designated poor counties to receive coordinated anti-poverty interventions. Evidence confirms that this program is multi-component and includes major cash transfer schemes: poor households in these counties were prioritized for rural subsistence allowances, and the government provided direct poverty-alleviation funds[4][7]. At the same time, a distinct mechanism of the TPA program was to offer multifaceted and locally tailored support, including substantial investments in productive assets: county and village cadres deployed measures such as agricultural guidance and industrial/agricultural development, including direct support for productive assets to poor households and industries[4]. However, the TPA program and the National Poor Counties interventions are not designed as 'graduation' programs in the manner of BRAC or similar to RCT-defined, time-bound, ultra-poor targeted graduation models; they are large-scale geographic and household-targeted poverty reduction interventions that employ a variety of mechanisms, including cash transfers and productive asset support, not as a bundled, sequenced graduation package but as adaptable, area-based poverty reduction policy. There is no evidence that the NPCs program used a rigid graduation sequencing or ultra-poor graduation methodology. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://voxchina.org/show-3-391.html, http://english.scio.gov.cn/whitepapers/2021-04/06/content_77380652_4.htm, https://www.aeaweb.org/research/china-college-officials-rural-development-poverty-subsidy",
