  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'IGMG Kurban Project' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The IGMG Kurban Project is run by the Islamic Community Milli Görüş (IGMG) and operates in 70+ countries. It focuses on the ritual distribution of Qurbani (sacrificial) meat during Eid al-Adha to needy populations. There is no evidence in available documentation or project descriptions that the IGMG Kurban Project functions as a multi-component, sequenced, time-bound graduation program aiming to help beneficiaries escape ultra-poverty through cash transfers, productive asset provision, or livelihoods training. Graduation programs—such as those led by BRAC, CGAP, or Islamic Relief—are distinctly characterized by rigorous targeting, sequenced interventions (including asset transfers, regular coaching, skills development, and savings promotion over 18–36 months) and programmatic support with measurable indicators focused on sustainable poverty reduction[1][2][3][4][6][8]. The IGMG Kurban Project does not provide ongoing cash transfers, productive assets, or livelihood support, rather its model revolves around one-off food/meat distribution for religious and immediate humanitarian relief purposes. It is not referenced in the literature or research on graduation, extreme poverty, or ultra-poor livelihood interventions. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.igmg.org/en/activities/qurbani/, https://islamic-relief.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IRWFalahGraduationModel-Summary.pdf, https://cgap.org/sites/default/files/CGAP-Focus-Note-Reaching-the-Poorest-Lessons-from-the-Graduation-Model-Mar-2011.pdf",
