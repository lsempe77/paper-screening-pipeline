It is not designed as a 'graduation' or multi-component ultra-poor program in the style of BRAC or J-PAL's graduation model, which targets extreme poverty through sequenced multi-component interventions including cash, assets, and mentorship. SLCP's primary goals are ecological (increase forest cover, reduce erosion) with a secondary target of poverty reduction, but it does not offer a structured graduation package or sequenced livelihoods approach[1][2][3][4][5]. Evidence consistently shows SLCP provides two main benefits: (1) cash or grain subsidies/compensation payments for retired land, and (2) provision of seedlings or other production inputs (i.e., productive assets for afforestation)[2][3]. However, some research notes that cash payments are sometimes withheld by local governments due to fiscal pressures and implementation issues, though the program's official design includes a cash transfer component[3]. The productive asset provision is explicit in the form of seedlings and support for establishing forests on converted land[2][3]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3093530/, https://www.cbd.int/financial/pes/china-pessloping.pdf, http://www.ccap.pku.edu.cn/docs/2018-04/20180408135720384976.pdf",
