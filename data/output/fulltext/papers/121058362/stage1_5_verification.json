  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Trickle Up Graduation Program'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources confirm that Trickle Up's intervention in Burkina Faso utilizes the 'Graduation Approach', which is designed as a multi-component, time-bound poverty alleviation program targeting the extreme poor, particularly women. Reference [1] details the sequence of program activities, explicitly describing participant selection, savings group formation, technical training, and most critically, asset transfer for livelihood generation, as well as 'individual grants' provided to participants. The same document directly states that the program distributes 'individual grants of 50,000 CFA' (a cash component) and uses these funds to finance livelihood plans (assets component). [2] further corroborates that Trickle Up's Graduation program in Burkina Faso is evaluated as a graduation approach, explicitly listing 'cash transfer with livelihood selection' (cash and asset support), in addition to skills training and savings. [4] confirms the program combines 'seed capital' (a form of productive asset transfer or grant), savings, and skills training. The consistent references to cash grants and asset transfers across these sources validate that both components are present. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://trickleup.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/OurWorkBurkinaFaso_2016_10.pdf, https://www.peiglobal.org/themes/custom/pei_b5/kc_files/Karimli,%20Bose%20and%20Kagotho%202019.pdf, https://trickleup.org/our-work-burkina-faso/",
