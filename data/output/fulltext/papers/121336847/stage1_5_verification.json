  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Nepal Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Nepal Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) is a community-driven development program that targets the rural poor, including those in extreme poverty. It is not a 'Graduation Approach' program as defined by BRAC or J-PAL, which typically combine asset transfers, training, financial support, coaching, and health services in a bundled, sequenced manner. The PAF model is based on a Community Demand Driven (CDD) approach, supporting the formation of community organizations and providing grants for local infrastructure projects, revolving funds for income generation, and savings and credit mobilization. This includes both cash transfers (in the form of grants and revolving funds) and productive assets (such as support for infrastructure projects and income-generating activities). However, the program does not follow the multi-component, sequenced, and bundled approach characteristic of the Graduation Approach. Evidence from World Bank and IFAD reports confirms that PAF provides cash and assets but does not include the full suite of components (training, coaching, health services) that define a Graduation program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://giwmscdntwo.gov.np/media/app/public/56/posts/1684843052_68.pdf, https://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/reports/nepal-poverty-alleviation-fund-project-0, https://www.ifad.org/documents/48415603/49457717/Nepal+1100001450+PAF+II+Project+Completion+Report+June+2019.pdf/2295d829-3d6d-5e47-ea2c-dfca4c299aa7?t=1726609137321",
