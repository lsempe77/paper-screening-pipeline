Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple authoritative sources explicitly confirm that Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) is structured as a multi-component program with both core safety net and graduation elements. PSNP has direct graduation pilots and models (like SPIR) which combine regular cash or food transfers with livelihood support such as technical training and productive (asset/cash) transfers to enable ultra-poor households to achieve self-reliance and leave the safety net. The cash component is clear: PSNP provides regular cash and/or food transfers to targeted poor households, serving as a consumption support safety net[3][6][9]. The productive assets component is also confirmed: graduation-focused interventions under PSNP include subsidized asset or cash transfers (e.g., livestock, poultry, or equivalent value cash) specifically to help households start or grow income-generating activities[2][3][4]. Studies and program manuals cite the combination of these interventions as integral to the PSNP graduation model[2][3][4][1]. Therefore, PSNP fulfills all three criteria with high confidence. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://www.care.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spir_learning_brief-sustainability_of_psnp_household_graduation-final_0.pdf",
