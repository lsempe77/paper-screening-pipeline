  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Emergency Safety Nets Project' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Mali Emergency Safety Nets Project (Jigisemejiri) is designed to increase access to targeted cash transfers for poor and food insecure households in Mali. According to the official World Bank project documentation, the project's primary intervention is the provision of regular cash transfers. There is no mention of productive asset transfers or a bundled, sequenced approach typical of graduation-style programs; the project is framed strictly as a social safety net, not a graduation model. A report from Humanitarian Outcomes confirms the focus on cash transfers in Mali's emergency safety net programming, indicating that the analysis of these programs was limited to cash assistance without reference to additional components such as provision of productive assets or sustained livelihood promotion. No credible evidence was found linking this program to graduation approaches or multi-component strategies involving asset transfers or skills training. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/930561531020867594/mali-emergency-safety-nets-project-jigisemejiri, https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/384511468052440939/mali-emergency-social-safety-nets-project, https://humanitarianoutcomes.org/sites/default/files/publications/linking_humanitarian_cash_and_social_protection_in_the_sahel_world_bank_final_report.pdf",
