  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Pro-Poor Tourism (PPT)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The term 'Pro-Poor Tourism (PPT)' refers to an approach or strategy within the tourism sector that aims to increase the net benefits from tourism accruing to the poor, primarily by increasing opportunities for participation, employment, local enterprise development, and access to tourism supply chains. The literature synthesizes various case studies in developing countries, showing that PPT interventions may include capacity building, collective benefits (infrastructure, training), and local employment but do not constitute a graduation program or poverty alleviation program with direct cash transfers or productive asset distribution like those modeled by BRAC or evaluated by J-PAL or IPA. PPT is not a multi-component ultra-poor graduation program; rather, it is a set of strategies or principles adopted in tourism projects to benefit the poor economically. None of the reviewed case studies or reviews indicate the provision of regular cash stipends or direct distribution of productive assets within PPT as a standard feature. Cash flows might occur indirectly through employment or business opportunities, and infrastructure development may occur, but these do not equate to targeted cash transfer programs or organized asset provision targeted at the ultra poor. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/9078IIED.pdf, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08d6e40f0b652dd00197e/R7557-PPT2.pdf, https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/a-case-of-pro-poor-tourism/46881126",
