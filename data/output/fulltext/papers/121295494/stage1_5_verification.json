  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The SHINE trial in Zimbabwe is a cluster-randomized, community-based health intervention focused on WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) to reduce child stunting and anemia. The intervention involves behavior change communication and provision of commodities related to sanitation and nutrition, delivered by village health workers. There is no evidence that the program is a graduation or multi-component poverty program in the style of BRAC, nor that it provides direct cash transfers or productive assets to poor households. The SHINE trial is a health and nutrition-focused randomized controlled trial, not an economic livelihoods program. While village health workers receive monetary allowances, participants (the poor rural households) do not receive cash or asset transfers. The trial’s interventions relate to the delivery of health messages and commodities for WASH and nutrition, not cash or productive assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4657589/, https://www.buffalo.edu/globalhealthequity/global-projects/the-global-child/mycotoxin-exposure--child-stunting-and-birth-outcomes--future-directions-for-the-shine-trial.html, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01824940",
