  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) program in India is a health intervention designed to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality by improving child healthcare practices and the capacity of healthcare providers. It is not mentioned in any credible sources as a graduation program, nor as a multi-component poverty alleviation program associated with cash transfers or productive asset provision. IMNCI focuses on children’s health through better diagnosis and treatment rather than targeting ultra-poor households with livelihoods, cash, or assets support. None of the provided references, nor additional authoritative health sources, list IMNCI under programs that offer cash transfers or productive assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.unicef.org/india/what-we-do/integrated-management-of-neonatal-and-childhood-illness, https://nhm.gov.in/index1.php?lang=1&level=2&sublinkid=1032&lid=1072",
