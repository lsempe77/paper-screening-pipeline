It focused on economic development in poor regions, especially through agriculture, labor export, out-migration projects, and the promotion of township enterprises[1][3][5][6]. The design and intent were primarily to increase rural incomes and productive capacity, not to deliver the multi-component support characteristic of 'graduation programs' (which typically include regular cash transfers, asset provision, coaching, and follow-up over 18–36 months). There is evidence of programmatic investment in productive assets and intensive support to production capital, but no direct evidence in public summaries of universal cash transfers or stipends to households. Instead, counties benefited from large-scale funding and policy support, with some microfinance pilots introduced mid-way[1]. There is no cited indication that the program used a household-level cash transfer model. The program's focus on infrastructure, productive investment, and out-migration most closely aligns with asset provision. Thus, it was not a graduation program and evidence for a systematic cash transfer is insufficient, but asset components are clear. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8129705/, https://documents.worldbank.org/pt/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/539811468743714961, https://www.tc.columbia.edu/coce/resources/",
