IBLI itself is not a multi-component graduation program and does not offer the full suite of interventions typically associated with graduation programs—such as targeted cash transfers, training, asset-transfer, or livelihood diversification support. Instead, it is a risk-management tool aiming to help households avoid distress sales and depletion of livestock during shocks. While research exists on integrating IBLI with graduation programs (such as with The BOMA Project), IBLI as a standalone program does not deliver regular cash transfers/stipends, nor does it directly provide productive assets. It delivers insurance payouts only conditional on a trigger event (drought) affecting forage levels, which are received as compensation, not as a cash stipend or asset grant. References [2][3][4][6] show that while IBLI can complement graduation programming, on its own it is not a graduation or multi-component program, nor does it provide direct cash or asset transfers. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://basis.ucdavis.edu/project/randomized-evaluation-integrated-graduation-and-contingent-social-protection-program-kenya, https://www.boma.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BOMA-Project-ILRI-RCT-Fact-Sheet-July-2019.pdf, https://www.ilri.org/knowledge/publications/fostering-social-inclusion-and-resilience-integrating-index-based-livestock",
