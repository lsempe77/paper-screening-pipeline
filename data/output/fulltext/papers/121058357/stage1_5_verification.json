Internet search found graduation programs in Pakistan: Perplexity search result: The National Poverty Graduation Programme (NPGP) in Pakistan is explicitly described as a 'graduation' or multi-component poverty program, aiming to assist ultra-poor households to move out of poverty through a set of interventions.[3][4][5] The program includes multiple components: asset transfer (i.e., provision of productive assets such as livestock, rickshaws) and training, interest-free loans, financial literacy, and social mobilization.[3][4] Several official and evaluation sources confirm both a productive asset transfer component and the use of cash or cash-equivalent support. The official program website makes clear reference to provision of social safety nets and cash transfers,[5] while evaluation literature details the distribution of productive assets such as livestock and rickshaws (personal transport).[3][4] The program's scope and structure mirror the recognized global 'Graduation' model pioneered by BRAC and evaluated by IPA/J-PAL.[2][6][7] Evidence from recent academic papers (March 2025) and the official NPGP site confirm the program delivers both cash stipends/transfers and productive assets through a multi-component sequence to the ultra-poor.[3][4][5] Therefore, all required criteria are unambiguously met. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.theigc.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/Nawaz-et-al-working-paper-march-2025.pdf, https://poverty-action.org/graduating-ultra-poor-pakistan, https://npgp.gov.pk/overview.html",
