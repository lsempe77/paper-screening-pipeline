  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Bangladesh Rajshahi Division Maternal and Child Nutrition (BRDMCN) program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: According to a peer-reviewed impact evaluation, the BRDMCN program, implemented by World Vision Bangladesh and World Vision Korea between 2018–2020, incorporated an economic development (ED) component that closely mirrors recognized 'graduation' models. The program provided productive assets for income generation (such as poultry and gardening resources), technical and saving trainings, and asset management skills specifically targeting poor and ultra-poor households. These components align with multifaceted livelihood graduation program standards, which typically include asset transfers, technical training, savings support, and health/nutrition education. The same source directly states the ED branch of BRDMCN 'adopted the components of graduation programs such as asset transfer for income generation, asset management skills and saving practices.' There is explicit confirmation of **asset transfer for income generation**, fulfilling the 'productive assets' criterion. However, while graduation programs often provide a short-term cash support ('consumption support'), I did not find clear documentation of a cash transfer or stipend component specifically within the BRDMCN implementation as described in the available sources. References to consumption support and the social protection nature of similar programs are present, but the exact presence or scale of a cash component in BRDMCN is not substantiated in the search results. Thus, while asset provision and graduation elements are confirmed, the cash transfer component remains unclear. | Graduation: YES, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10019051/, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/16549716.2022.2031595",
