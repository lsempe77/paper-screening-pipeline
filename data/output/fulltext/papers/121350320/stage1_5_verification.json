The evidence shows that the main intervention is the provision of subsidized fertilizer—a productive asset input—not cash or stipends. There is no indication from authoritative sources that the program includes direct cash transfers or a broader graduation approach, which would typically combine cash, training, and asset transfers to address ultra-poverty[2][3][6]. The program is also not explicitly targeted at the ultra poor with a multi-component livelihoods package in the way that BRAC or graduation programs are; rather, it is framed around agricultural subsidy, sometimes with mixed economic and welfare objectives but not a comprehensive graduation design[3]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://agra.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/scale-and-impacts-brief-18-06-24.pdf, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/profitability-fertilizer-mali, https://www.canr.msu.edu/fsp/publications/research-papers/RP_169.pdf",
