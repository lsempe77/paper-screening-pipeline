  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Federal Reindeer Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Federal Reindeer Program in Alaska, later managed by the US Reindeer Service, was designed as a livestock asset transfer and apprenticeship initiative for Alaska Native communities, particularly Inuit/Eskimo, Inupiat, and Yupik. The central mechanism was the provision of reindeer through loans or transfers, after completion of a multi-year apprenticeship, aiming to develop a self-sustaining reindeer herding economy[1][2][3][4][6]. Participants would receive live animals (productive assets) and were expected to repay the 'loan' in kind (i.e., in reindeer as the herd grew)[1][6]. There is no evidence that the program provided direct cash transfers, stipends, or routine income supplements; its function was not like modern multi-component poverty graduation programs studied by BRAC or evaluated by J-PAL/IPA (i.e., combining coaching, cash and assets). Instead, it was an asset-based livelihood program using reindeer as productive assets to encourage indigenous economic self-sufficiency. Historical sources and policy documents do not mention cash components, nor any graduation-like framework as defined in recent poverty intervention literature (e.g., Banerjee et al. 2015, Bandiera et al. 2017)[1][3]. The official name used in historical and regulatory sources is 'Federal Reindeer Program,' 'US Reindeer Service,' or simply the 'Alaska Native Reindeer Industry.' | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://egc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2021-04/2021-0423%20EconHistory%20Conference/Reindeer%20Resilience%20and%20Indigenous%20Communities%20April%202021%20conference%20-%20CGM%20AC%20ada-ns.pdf, https://foresthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Blegen-2007_Willis-Roxanne.pdf, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer_Act",
