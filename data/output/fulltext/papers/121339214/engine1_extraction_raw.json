  "raw_text": "I apologize, but from the provided paper excerpt, I cannot extract meaningful information about a cash transfer or productive asset program. This appears to be a policy analysis paper about Ghana's economic growth and poverty reduction from a macro perspective. It does not describe any specific intervention program with cash or asset components.\n\nHere is what I can provide based on the available content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"paper_metadata\": {\n    \"title\": null,\n    \"matches_expected_title\": \"NO\"\n  },\n  \"program_information\": {\n    \"program_name\": null,\n    \"country\": \"Ghana\",\n    \"region\": \"National\",\n    \"target_population\": null\n  },\n  \"intervention_components\": {\n    \"component_a_cash_support\": {\n      \"component_a_present\": false,\n      \"cash_support_type\": null,\n      \"cash_amount\": null,\n      \"cash_frequency\": null,\n      \"is_loan_or_credit\": \"NO\",\n      \"cash_evidence_citation\": null\n    },\n    \"component_b_assets\": {\n      \"component_b_present\": false,\n      \"assets_provided\": [],\n      \"direct_provision\": \"UNCLEAR\",\n      \"assets_evidence_citation\": null\n    }\n  },\n  \"study_characteristics\": {\n    \"outcomes_measured\": [\"poverty reduction\", \"economic growth\"],\n    \"outcomes_evidence_citation\": \"This growth has been associated with significant progress in poverty reduction, both in income and nonincome terms\",\n    \"study_design\": \"Policy analysis\",\n    \"design_evidence_citation\": null,\n    \"is_review_or_policy_analysis\": true,\n    \"publication_year\": null,\n    \"study_conducted_year\": null,\n    \"sample_size\": null,\n    \"completed\": true\n  },\n  \"bonus_information\": {\n    \"has_qualitative_components\": false,\n    \"qualitative_methods\": [],\n    \"qualitative_evidence_citation\": null,\n    \"has_cost_data\": false,\n    \"cost_mentions\": null,\n    \"cost_evidence_citation\": null\n  },\n  \"evidence_citations\": {\n    \"program_name_citation\": null,\n    \"country_citation\": \"Ghana managed an impressive economic turnaround after more than 20 years of serious decline\",\n    \"target_population_citation\": null\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis paper appears to be a policy analysis examining Ghana's broader economic development rather than evaluating a specific cash transfer or productive asset program. Please provide another paper if you'd like me to extract information about a specific intervention program."
