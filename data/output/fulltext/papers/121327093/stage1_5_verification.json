The primary purpose of the program was to provide means-tested monthly cash allowances to families with low incomes, helping them pay for basic living expenses like food, bills, and rent. The cash transfer amount depended on household economic conditions (ISEE). Though beneficiaries had to fulfill some activation requirements—such as training, accepting job offers, and participating in community projects—there is no evidence from official sources or academic evaluations that the program provided productive asset transfers (such as livestock, business grants, or tools), nor did it integrate the multi-sectoral, time-limited approach typical of 'graduation' programs as defined by international organizations (such as BRAC or the World Bank). The RdC focused primarily on income support and labor activation, not asset-building or ultra-poor graduation out of extreme poverty. Therefore, it is classified as a minimum income cash transfer with no asset component, not a graduation program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://italy.refugee.info/en-us/articles/5388918400663, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens'_income_(Italy), https://journals.openedition.org/rdctss/775?lang=en",
