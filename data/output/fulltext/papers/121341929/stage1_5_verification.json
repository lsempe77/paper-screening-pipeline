  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'One House One Farm (Ektee Bari Ektee Khamar)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The 'Ektee Bari Ektee Khamar' (One House One Farm) program is a rural poverty alleviation project launched in Bangladesh that aims to mobilize poor rural households to form groups (samitis), pool small savings, and receive matching grants from the government for productive investments. Several authoritative sources (including World Bank and Government of Bangladesh documentation) describe this as a micro-savings and asset-building scheme, designed to facilitate collective investment in productive assets such as livestock, poultry, and agricultural inputs, rather than a cash transfer or graduation program. While the program mobilizes savings and provides matching government grants, these grants are earmarked for productive assets, not direct household cash consumption. The program is not classified in academic or official policy literature as a 'graduation program'—which is generally defined by direct cash (or asset) transfers, intensive training, mentoring, and time-bound sequencing toward sustainable self-sufficiency (such as the classic BRAC graduation model). The One House One Farm program focuses explicitly on group-managed investment in productive assets. There is limited or inconclusive evidence the program issues unconditional or recurring cash transfers to individual households, so the cash transfer component status is 'UNCLEAR.' Asset provision for income-generating activities is a core verified element. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/07/06/bangladesh-empowers-the-rural-poor-through-one-house-one-farm-scheme, https://www.ektee-bari-ektee-khamar.gov.bd/, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311591760_Ektee_Bari_Ektee_Khamar_Project_A_role_model_in_rural_development_of_Bangladesh",
