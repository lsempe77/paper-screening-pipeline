  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'China's national poverty alleviation campaign' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: China's national poverty alleviation campaign is officially called the Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) Campaign. It is a large-scale, multi-dimensional strategy to eradicate poverty, not a classic 'graduation program' as defined by organizations like BRAC or J-PAL. Graduation programs, in technical literature, are characterized by coordinated, time-bound packages that combine cash or in-kind transfers, asset provision, livelihood training, coaching, and financial inclusion, usually focused on ultra-poor populations with a clear exit ('graduation') criterion. The TPA offers multiple supports and has explicit multidimensional indicators for poverty relief, but is fundamentally a government-driven, multi-year, multi-sector campaign without the structured, small-cohort, intensive coaching component that defines graduation programs[1][3]. China’s TPA does provide regular cash transfers to poor households in the form of subsistence allowances, minimum living standard guarantees (dibao), and social assistance, and spent billions in direct financial support[3][2]. It also has a major assets component: poor households have received livestock, agricultural inputs, support to set up businesses, and in many cases, subsidized or free relocation to new apartments with productive resources. Official documents and analyses by the World Bank and policy summaries confirm extensive productive asset support alongside health, education, and housing guarantees[3][5][1]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2022/02/how-china-defeated-poverty/, http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/special/2021jpxbg.pdf, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation",
