Evidence from multiple official sources and impact evaluations demonstrates that LEAP is primarily a social cash transfer scheme aiming to alleviate short-term poverty and promote long-term human capital development[1][2][3][5][6][7]. However, there is no credible evidence from program descriptions, official reports, or evaluations that LEAP provides productive assets (such as livestock, equipment, or capital for income-generating activities) to beneficiaries—a key feature of graduation programs. Graduation programs typically combine cash transfers with productive assets and intensive training/coaching, but LEAP is described only as providing cash and health insurance. No reference is made to graduation-type multi-component interventions, productive asset provision, or integrated livelihood packages. LEAP is therefore not considered a graduation program nor does it include a productive assets component. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/ghana/, https://www.ssph-journal.org/journals/international-journal-of-public-health/articles/10.3389/ijph.2023.1605336/full, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a089ad40f0b649740001f2/LEAP_Impact_Evaluation_FINAL2014march17.pdf",
