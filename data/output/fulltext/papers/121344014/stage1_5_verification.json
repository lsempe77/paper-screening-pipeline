  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Local Government Development Program (LGDP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Local Government Development Program (LGDP) in Uganda is primarily a government decentralization and local infrastructure development initiative, designed to strengthen local government capacity for service delivery, planning, and infrastructure investment. There is no credible evidence in the search results that LGDP is designed as a graduation or multi-component poverty program targeting ultra-poor households, nor does it follow the BRAC-style graduation model (which includes sequenced interventions such as cash transfers, training, and productive assets)[3][4][6]. Graduation programs in Uganda are referenced as separate models such as those by BRAC, Village Enterprise, and others explicitly targeting ultra-poor with cash, assets, and training, and there is no documented link between LGDP and these poverty graduation interventions. Furthermore, there is no evidence LGDP itself provides cash transfers or productive assets directly to the poor; its stated focus is on local government institutional strengthening and infrastructure, not on poverty graduation or direct economic inclusion.[3] | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://ssir.org/articles/entry/government-partnerships-poverty-solutions, https://bracupgi.org/news-updates/economic-inclusion/introducing-the-graduation-essentials-core-components-designed-for-scale/, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evidence-effect/graduation-approach",
