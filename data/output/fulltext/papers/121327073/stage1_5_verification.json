Its main goals are improving land rights, reducing disputes, and encouraging sustainable investment in land. Extensive evaluations and program documentation (including those for LIFT, ELTAP, ELAP) confirm that these programs do not provide cash transfers, stipends, or direct productive assets to beneficiaries. The intervention is administrative and legal, not a direct anti-poverty program like a graduation model (which typically combines cash, asset transfers, and training). While the program may encourage better land investment and secondary economic impacts, it does not itself include the transfer of cash or productive assets, nor is it part of a multi-component poverty/graduation program in the internationally-recognized sense. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.dai.com/news/lift-programme-issues-second-level-land-certificates-ethiopia, https://library.cepa.org.mw/wp-content/uploads/tainacan-items/20/779/Unbundling-Land-Administrative-Reform-Demand-for-Second-Stage-Land-Certification-in-Ethiopia.pdf, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/agec.12834",
