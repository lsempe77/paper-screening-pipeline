Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Ethiopia Food Security Programme (FSP) bundles the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP), initially the Other Food Security Programme (OFSP), later replaced by the Household Asset Building Programme (HABP). The FSP is explicitly structured as a multi-component program with a core graduation objective: to help ultra-poor and chronically food-insecure households permanently exit poverty[1][3][5]. Graduation is operationalized through benchmarks that require both food self-sufficiency and ownership of productive assets. PSNP provides regular cash or food transfers (sometimes conditioned on labor through public works or unconditionally for direct support)[3][7]. The OFSP/HABP complements this with access to productive assets, such as livestock, agricultural inputs, and training—all targeted to build resilient livelihoods for graduation[1][5]. Multiple sources confirm that the pathway to graduation combines cash/social protection and asset accumulation components, with evidence from government manuals and program evaluations. The official name is 'Ethiopia Food Security Programme (FSP)', with PSNP and OFSP/HABP as components. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a089d940f0b649740002c8/FAC_Working_Paper_080.pdf, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10844108/, https://www.care.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spir_learning_brief-sustainability_of_psnp_household_graduation-final_0.pdf",
