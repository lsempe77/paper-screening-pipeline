  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Coconut farming interventions' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: There is no evidence that the 'Coconut farming interventions' in the Philippines are modeled after graduation or multi-component anti-poverty programs (like the BRAC graduation approach). These interventions, detailed under the Coconut Farmers Industry Development Plan (CFIDP), primarily focus on capacity building, training, business development, and the provision of productive assets such as improved planting materials, farming tools, and technology transfer. There is no mention of regular cash transfers or stipends as part of these programs. However, participants do receive certain productive assets (e.g., shovels, improved seedlings, and occasional support for hybridization and processing facilities). Training and knowledge transfer are central, but traditional graduation program components like comprehensive cash transfers, life coaching, and sequential support packages are not described in the available documentation. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://ati2.da.gov.ph/ati-4b/content/article/erlan-d-pasana/graduation-ceremony-masaganang-coco-buhayan-school-air-program-romblon, https://ati2.da.gov.ph/ati-10/content/article/vic-thor-palarca/various-coco-based-products-income-sources-showcased-fbs-graduates-lanao, https://pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/index.php/about-chp",
