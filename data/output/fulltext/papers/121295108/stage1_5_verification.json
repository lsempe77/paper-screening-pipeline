  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: NRLM (DAY-NRLM) is India’s flagship rural poverty alleviation program, focusing on universal coverage and supporting self-employment and skilled wage employment for the rural poor, especially through women’s self-help groups[1][4]. The program’s core approach is not the multi-component 'graduation model' as originally defined by BRAC (which combines cash, assets, training, health, and coaching in a sequenced package), but rather a broader livelihood promotion strategy[1]. However, NRLM has piloted graduation-style programs in partnership with organizations like Trickle Up and BRAC in some states (e.g., Jharkhand, Bihar), integrating selected graduation components into the NRLM framework for targeted subgroups[1][3]. At the national level, NRLM itself is not a graduation program, but adaptations and pilots within it may use graduation elements. There is no clear evidence that NRLM provides regular, unconditional cash transfers or stipends as a standard component at scale. Productive asset transfers (e.g., livestock, tools) are sometimes part of NRLM-linked projects or pilots, but not systematically documented as a national program feature. Recent MOUs with BRAC aim to include the 'poorest of the poor' under NRLM, potentially expanding graduation and asset-based interventions, but these are not yet uniformly implemented nationwide[3][5]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: MEDIUM | Sources: https://www.cgap.org/blog/introducing-graduation-approach-in-indias-jharkhand-state, https://bracupgi.org/program/india/, https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2011/07/05/the-national-rural-livelihoods-project",
