It provided a package of interventions including skills training (through TRYSEM), access to credit, subsidies, and, most importantly, productive income-generating assets such as livestock, equipment, and land. While the program provided financial assistance and subsidies, these were explicitly meant for the acquisition of productive assets, not as direct cash transfers or stipends. IRDP is considered an early example of a 'graduation approach'—it aimed to help ultra-poor households move out of poverty through asset creation, capacity building, and livelihood support, but did not provide regular cash transfers. There is no credible evidence that the IRDP or RPW schemes gave beneficiaries unconditional or regular cash transfers or stipends; instead, financial flows were tied to asset acquisition or as subsidies toward self-employment. | Graduation: YES, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://paytm.com/blog/saving-schemes/government-schemes/objectives-of-integrated-rural-development-program-irdp/, https://testbook.com/ias-preparation/integrated-rural-development-programme-irdp, https://opentextbooks.colvee.org/fundamentalsofagextn/chapter_w5-01-extension-innovations-in-extension-and-development-irdp-naep-sfac.html",
