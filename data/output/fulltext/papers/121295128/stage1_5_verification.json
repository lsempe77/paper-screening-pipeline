Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) in Ethiopia is widely cited as one of the key government-led social protection programs, focusing on the most vulnerable and chronically food-insecure households[7][9]. PSNP is a multi-component poverty program designed both to provide short-term consumption support and enable households to graduate out of poverty. Several sources confirm that PSNP serves as the foundation for various 'graduation' approaches targeting the extremely poor, notably including pilots developed by organizations such as CGAP, the Ford Foundation, and CARE in partnership with the Ethiopian government[1][3]. Graduation within the PSNP context is defined as a household achieving food security and resilience such that it no longer requires external PSNP support[3]. The program components explicitly include regular cash or food transfers to beneficiaries[3][7][4], as well as asset transfers or subsidized cash meant to facilitate productive income-generating activities and livelihood diversification[3][4]. For instance, the SPIR project under PSNP delivered a cash or poultry asset transfer to particularly poor households as part of the graduation model[4]. This evidence collectively demonstrates that PSNP both serves as a platform for graduation and provides both cash and productive asset support to targeted households. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://www.care.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spir_learning_brief-sustainability_of_psnp_household_graduation-final_0.pdf",
