Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple peer-reviewed studies and program documents indicate that the Women for Women International (WfWI) program in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a graduation program targeting ultra-poor women. It delivers a bundled, multi-component intervention over 12 months, emphasizing both economic and social empowerment. The intervention specifically follows the graduation approach originated by BRAC, combining livelihood development, social protection, and financial inclusion. Evidence from randomized controlled trials and official program materials confirm the provision of financial support (cash transfers or micro business capital)[1][2][3], business skill development, and start-up vocational kits (productive assets)[3]. The program is explicitly referenced as a graduation program by independent evaluations and WfWI documentation. The multifaceted nature and explicit references to both 'capital' (usually cash) and 'vocational kits' (productive assets) confirm both components are included. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://econ.washington.edu/sites/econ/files/documents/research/drc_1.pdf, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/sites/default/files/research-paper/AngelucciHeathNoble_DRC.pdf, https://www.womenforwomen.org/media/1199",
