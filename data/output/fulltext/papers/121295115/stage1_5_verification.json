Major activities included maternal/child health, nutrition, agriculture, natural resource management, and market linkage, with significant focus on agribusiness value chains and technical support for farmers. While the program promoted sustainable livelihoods through technical training, collective marketing, and improved agricultural practices, there is no evidence in official evaluations or partner documents that WALA directly provided cash transfers or productive asset grants typical of 'graduation' models targeting ultra-poor populations. Graduation programs involve multi-component interventions including cash, productive assets, and coaching, explicitly detailed in related CRS and FARMSE projects elsewhere in Malawi[4][6]. WALA focused on capacity building, organizing marketing clusters, and facilitating access to markets, rather than direct financial or asset-based inputs. No source confirms WALA meeting graduation program criteria or delivering cash or assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://reliefweb.int/report/malawi/long-term-impact-evaluation-malawi-wellness-and-agriculture-life-advancement-program, https://www.acdivoca.org/projects/wellness-and-agriculture-for-life-advancement-wala/, https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/assessment-wellness-and-agriculture-life-advancement-wala-activity",
