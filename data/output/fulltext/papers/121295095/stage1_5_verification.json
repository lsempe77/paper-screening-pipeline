Search did not find relevant graduation programs in Unknown: Perplexity search result: The phrase 'government-led national cash transfer programme' is generic and not unique to any specific country or official program. Based on global literature, most government-led national cash transfer programs provide direct cash transfers to impoverished households[4][9]. Some government-led programs have incorporated elements of the 'graduation' model, which includes multi-component support such as productive asset transfer, training, and coaching, but this is not standard for all such programs[1][2][3]. Cash is a common component, but provision of productive assets is typical only of programs explicitly adopting a graduation approach[2]. Without specific country or program details, it is not possible to confirm whether this unnamed program is a graduation program or includes asset transfers. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: YES, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: LOW | Sources: https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/social-protection/global-issues-and-debates-2/graduation-and-cash-plus/, https://poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/2024-10/Executive%20Summary%20Designing%20Cash%20Transfers%20and%20Graduation%20Programs.pdf, https://www.arab-reform.net/publication/can-poverty-graduation-programs-truly-free-the-poor-from-poverty-reflections-on-international-and-regional-experiences/",
