Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple authoritative sources confirm that the CFPR program by BRAC in Bangladesh is the original 'graduation' model, combining social protection, livelihoods development, and access to finance in a sequenced, multi-component approach for the ultra-poor[1][6]. Evidence from impact evaluations and program documentation show participants receive cash stipends for basic consumption in the initial phase[1], followed by productive asset transfers such as livestock or equipment to support income-generating activities[3][1]. The program includes training, coaching, and additional support, which is characteristic of holistic graduation programs. These features have been widely evaluated, documented, and scaled globally as a model for extreme poverty interventions. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.cgap.org/sites/default/files/graduation_guide_final.pdf, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09614524.2024.2317836, https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/11053/DISSERTATION_Jalal%20Chowdhury_June29.pdf;sequence=1",
