  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Precision Poverty Alleviation Policy' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Precision Poverty Alleviation Program (PPA), launched by the Chinese government from 2013 and formalized in 2015, is a nationwide, highly targeted poverty reduction campaign aiming to eradicate absolute poverty by 2020. The PPA targets households and individuals using a poverty registry and coordinates a range of interventions, including direct financial support such as subsidies and living allowances—constituting a cash transfer component. In addition, the PPA delivers productive assets and in-kind support, such as livestock, equipment, and investment in rural industries, tailored to each family or community; this matches the 'productive assets' component. However, the PPA is a multi-faceted national social policy, not a graduation program in the sense defined in international development literature (e.g., BRAC's model) that combines time-bound sequenced interventions with a clear exit/graduation pathway driven by livelihood building and monitored progress. The PPA is ongoing, broad in scope, and oriented toward blanket poverty eradication and social stability rather than testing the graduation approach as conceptualized by institutions like BRAC, IPA, or J-PAL. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.bpastudies.org/index.php/bpastudies/article/download/230/441/, https://thetricontinental.org/wenhua-zongheng-2023-2-targeted-poverty-alleviation-rural-governance/, https://www.prcleader.org/post/will-china-eliminate-poverty-in-2020",
