The program targets conditional cash transfer (CCT) beneficiaries but is structured to enhance financial inclusion and productive livelihoods through training, financial education, savings, and investment in productive activities rather than direct cash transfers[1][5]. Its main focus is helping households develop microbusinesses and invest in economic and productive activities, which clearly indicates the provision of productive assets (skills, equipment, or seed capital for income-generating activities)[1][5]. Nowhere in the official JICA project completion report is the ACTIVO project described as giving additional cash transfers or stipends beyond the base CCT program; its new component is the productive inclusion support. Thus, the project is a graduation approach (by design), has an asset/productive inclusion component, and does not provide a new or additional cash component. | Graduation: YES, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://openjicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/12356028.pdf, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19439342.2024.2394478, https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/435031645777804902/pdf/Operational-Considerations-for-Urban-Economic-Inclusion-Programming.pdf",
