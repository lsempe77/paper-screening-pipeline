  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Baby's First Years (BFY)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Baby's First Years (BFY) is a large-scale randomized controlled trial in the United States, providing unconditional monthly cash gifts to low-income mothers of newborns to assess the impact of poverty reduction on early childhood development[1][2][3][6]. The program delivers cash transfers ($333/month for 40+ months for the high-cash group) via electronic debit cards, with the intention of improving child and family outcomes through increased financial resources[1][2][3]. There is no evidence that BFY provides productive assets (e.g., livestock, equipment, or other material asset transfers), nor is it structured as a graduation or multi-component livelihood program designed for ultra-poor families, such as BRAC's graduation model. It is solely focused on unconditional cash transfers to study their effect on child development, and not on broader economic or livelihood advancement through multi-component intervention[1][2][3][5][6]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8487960/, https://cogsci.uconn.edu/2019/09/23/nichd-funded-post-doctorates-babys-first-years-study/, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03593356",
