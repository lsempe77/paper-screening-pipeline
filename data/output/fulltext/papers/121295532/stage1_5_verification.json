  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Shonjibon Cash and Counselling' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Shonjibon Cash and Counselling program in Bangladesh is a cluster randomized controlled trial aiming to evaluate the effects of unconditional cash transfers combined with mobile-based nutrition counselling on reducing child undernutrition. Multiple sources—including peer-reviewed published trials and research presentations—describe it as a cash transfer program with nutrition behavior change communications. There is no evidence from peer-reviewed articles, program summaries, or trial protocols that the program provides productive assets to recipients. Graduation programs typically involve multi-component interventions (cash, assets, training, etc.) designed to lift the ultra-poor out of poverty, but the Shonjibon program focuses specifically on cash transfers and counseling, not productive asset transfers or livelihoods support. The official program name 'Shonjibon Cash and Counselling' is consistently referenced in scholarly and conference sources. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33238946/, https://www.3ieimpact.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/Food-Systems-Nutrition-EGM-in-brief-update-7.pdf, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0590-3917",
