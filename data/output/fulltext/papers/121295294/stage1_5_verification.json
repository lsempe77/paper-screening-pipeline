Multiple authoritative sources, including academic studies and official program documentation, consistently confirm that LEAP’s primary intervention is cash grants combined with free health insurance enrollment. There is no evidence in these sources that LEAP directly provides productive assets (e.g., livestock, equipment, or business grants typical in graduation programs), nor does it fit the definition of a 'graduation' program, which typically combines cash, training, and assets for the ultra-poor as seen in BRAC or IPA models. Rather, LEAP is structured as a social safety net rather than a multi-component livelihoods graduation program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://academic.oup.com/policyandsociety/advance-article/doi/10.1093/polsoc/puaf020/8238210?searchresult=1, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02589001.2024.2391032, https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/ghana/",
