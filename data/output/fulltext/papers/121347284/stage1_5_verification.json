Authoritative sources clearly state that the main intervention is the provision of preferential credit (loans) and not direct cash transfers, stipends, or unconditional monetary grants[1][4][5][6][7][8]. There is no evidence from official evaluations, impact assessments, or academic literature that the program systematically distributes productive assets (such as livestock, equipment, or tools) to clients as a core component. Most sources focus on credit access, the role of loans in financing microenterprises, and how these loans can increase incomes and reduce poverty, but do not reference grants or asset transfers. Graduation programs are defined by a multi-component approach that combines sequenced cash, assets, training, savings, and mentoring; there is no evidence that VBSP systematically implements this comprehensive, bundled approach as pioneered by BRAC and evaluated by J-PAL/IPA. VBSP is a traditional microcredit provider, not a graduation program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/54154/1/MPRA_paper_54154.pdf, https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/920381614318030116/pdf/Review-of-the-Vietnam-Bank-for-Social%20Policies.pdf, https://www.emerald.com/jed/article/24/1/18/220603/The-impact-of-the-Vietnam-Bank-for-Social-Policies",
