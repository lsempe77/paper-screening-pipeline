  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Changshun County Agricultural Development Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: A targeted search for the 'Changshun County Agricultural Development Program' in China did not yield direct evidence or program documentation linking this initiative to multi-component graduation approaches such as those modeled on BRAC's ultra-poor graduation model, or to impact evaluations available via international organizations. Most available sources discuss provincial or national agricultural development and rural revitalization projects, with a focus on infrastructure, technology deployment, and crop/seed improvement. None mention direct cash transfer or stipend components (such as unconditional or conditional cash transfers to households) nor direct provision of productive assets typical of graduation models for the ultra-poor. All sources refer to broader agricultural modernization, rural infrastructure, and demonstration zones—mainly in Changchun (Jilin Province), not Changshun (Guizhou Province or other possible locations). Without direct program documentation, third-party evaluations, or media references specifying cash or asset components, it remains unclear whether the program meets graduation model criteria or provides the specified benefits. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: LOW | Sources: https://www.gojilin.gov.cn/2022/06/01/c_9244.htm, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40593977/, https://ewsdata.rightsindevelopment.org/files/documents/07/WB-P178907_kwtqfzh.pdf",
