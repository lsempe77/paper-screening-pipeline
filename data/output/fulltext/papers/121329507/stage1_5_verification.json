Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources confirm that 'integrated graduation-style programs' in Uganda are multi-component poverty alleviation programs, typically based on the BRAC/IPA model. These programs explicitly combine monthly cash transfers for consumption support[1][4][5][6], followed by one-time productive asset transfers to households as capital for starting income-generating activities[1][6]. They also include training, mentorship/coaching, and access to savings. Both the AVSI SMILES project[1][6] and the CARE WAYREP MPCT Graduation Approach[3] in Uganda implement this integrated model, providing cash, productive assets, and coaching. BRAC's referenced approach also fits these criteria[4]. The program definition is supported by IPA and World Bank-published reviews, which classify interventions with cash transfer, asset transfer, coaching, savings, and training as 'graduation' programs[2]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.avsi.org/en/news-and-press/news/cash-transfers-in-a-graduation-programme-what-we-did-and-what-we-learnt, https://care.at/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-MPCT-Learning-Brief-full-report.pdf, https://poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/2024-09/Designing-Cash-Transfer-and-Graduation-Programs-Evidence-Synthesis.pdf",
