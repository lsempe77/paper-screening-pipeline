  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'National Program for Rural Poverty Alleviation (2001-2010)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The program, officially known as the 'Outline for Poverty Alleviation and Development of China's Rural Areas (2001–2010),' was designed as a comprehensive, development-oriented poverty alleviation strategy focusing on rural regions.[1][2][3] Its primary components included developing agriculture, promoting the planting and breeding industries, supporting agricultural industrialization, improving basic production and living conditions, enhancing access to technology and education, and strengthening income-generating capacities.[2][3] These features demonstrate a broad, multi-component approach to rural poverty reduction rather than a 'graduation' program in the sense defined by BRAC or J-PAL, which typically involves sequenced interventions combining cash, productive assets, training, and time-limited support for the ultra-poor. The program did provide support for productive assets such as agricultural inputs, improved technologies, infrastructure, and sometimes small livestock, directly aiming to raise productivity and livelihoods.[2][3] Evidence for direct cash transfers or stipends as a widespread, systematic component in this 2001-2010 phase is lacking and not confirmed; rather, the main income support mechanisms at the time seem to refer to the rural minimum living security system (dibao), which is related but distinct and largely expanded closer to 2010.[1][2] Thus, assets support is confirmed, cash less so, and the program is not a strict 'graduation' program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://yearbook.iprcc.org.cn/zggjfpzxnj/jjzgzkxfzgjknywb/kptfpa/402269.shtml, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7916877/, https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714182/39730031/china.pdf",
