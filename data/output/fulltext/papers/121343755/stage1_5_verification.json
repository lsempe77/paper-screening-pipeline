The main function of M-PESA is to provide a platform for digital financial transactions and increase financial inclusion. Several studies, such as the one cited in [1], document that the widespread use of M-PESA has had significant positive impacts on poverty reduction and resilience by enabling users to access, save, and transfer money more efficiently. However, M-PESA itself is **not a graduation program, nor is it a direct cash transfer or asset-provisioning program**. Rather, it is an enabling infrastructure used by households and by other programs (e.g., poverty graduation pilots or cash transfer interventions) as a channel for disbursing funds. Some graduation programs operating in Kenya (such as PROFIT by BOMA/BRAC) have provided assets, cash, and training—sometimes utilizing M-PESA as a delivery mechanism for cash or savings—but those are separate, explicitly designed graduation interventions, not M-PESA itself. M-PESA does not provide cash or productive assets directly; it is simply a platform facilitating transactions. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.georgetown.edu/news/study-use-of-mobile-money-lifts-nearly-200000-kenyans-out-of-poverty/, https://bracupgi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BRAC_PROFIT-Financial-Graduation-Report-Nov-2019.pdf, https://boma.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BOMA-Project-PROFIT-Mideline-Report-Key-Findings-Summary.pdf",
