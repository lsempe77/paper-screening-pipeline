These interventions focus on health education, provision of training manuals, supervision, recruitment, and sometimes logistical support such as transport for health assistants[2]. There is no evidence indicating that these maternal health information interventions provide cash transfers or stipends directly to beneficiaries (e.g., mothers or ultra-poor households). In some cases, community health assistants may receive monthly remuneration as part of their employment or as an incentive[2], but this is not classified as a cash transfer to program beneficiaries as part of an anti-poverty or graduation program. There is also no evidence showing provision of productive assets (e.g., livestock, farm equipment, enterprise startup support), which are typical features of graduation or multi-component livelihood programs, such as those modeled after BRAC or the World Bank's graduation approach. The interventions described are not structured as graduation programs, which typically include sequenced components of cash transfer, assets, training, and follow-up targeting ultra-poor households for sustainable poverty reduction. Instead, they are health service delivery interventions, often implemented through government and donor agencies concerned with improving maternal and child health outcomes. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0902, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12065303/, https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0296001",
