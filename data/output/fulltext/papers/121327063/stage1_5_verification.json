Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Child Grants Programme (CGP) in Lesotho is a well-established unconditional cash transfer (CT) scheme targeting poor and vulnerable households with children, providing quarterly cash transfers to reduce malnutrition, improve health, and increase school enrolment[2][3][5][6][8]. The SPRINGS component (Sustainable Poverty Reduction through Income, Nutrition and access to Government Services) was layered on CGP as a 'cash plus' graduation-style intervention. SPRINGS aimed to facilitate graduation out of poverty through complementary support in livelihood development, specifically by promoting income-generating activities, skills training, and provision of productive assets[1]. Evaluation reports confirm that the CGP+SPRINGS program integrates regular cash transfers with assets transfer and economic empowerment interventions, matching the graduation program model[1][4]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lesotho-CGP-SPRINGS-Impact-Report_FINAL.pdf, https://www.calpnetwork.org/publication/child-grants-programme-impact-evaluation-follow-up-report/, https://www.opml.co.uk/projects/evaluation-child-grants-programme-lesotho",
