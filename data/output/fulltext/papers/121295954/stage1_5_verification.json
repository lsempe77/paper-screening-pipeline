  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Economic assistance program'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources clearly describe graduation programs in Uganda, notably the 'Graduating to Resilience' program (USAID/AVSI/Save the Children)[1][3][5]. These programs target ultra-poor or refugee populations and follow the classic 'graduation approach' that involves multi-component support: (a) cash asset transfers and ongoing consumption support (cash stipends)[1][3], and (b) productive asset transfers (such as grants, livestock, equipment)[1][2]. Source [1] details randomized evaluations including variants with and without asset transfers, clearly noting that the full graduation group receives both initial cash asset transfer and continuing cash, as well as coaching and savings training. Source [2] confirms productive asset transfers and consumption support. Source [3] documents a $205 lump-sum cash grant per participant (for business start-up) and coaching. These match all criteria: graduation methodology, cash transfers, and asset provision. The formal name for current major programming is 'Graduating to Resilience.' The evidence is drawn from randomized controlled trials and official implementer documentation. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/impact-graduation-program-livelihoods-refugee-and-host-communities-uganda, https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/events/poverty-graduation-new-evidence-effective-disability-inclusive-approach-uganda, https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2025-11-02/they-were-promised-a-lifeline-to-graduate-from-poverty-then-it-was-taken-away",
