Its core components included providing poor rural families with grants to purchase land as well as inputs needed for farm development, covering both agricultural productive assets (land itself and inputs) and accompanying cash grants for resettlement costs (such as moving and building shelter)[2][1]. While this multi-component support aids productive capacity and income, there is no evidence that CBRLDP explicitly followed the 'graduation approach' model as defined by BRAC, J-PAL, or IPA (which require a coordinated package of time-bound interventions—cash, assets, training, and mentoring—with explicit graduation/exit criteria for ultra-poor beneficiaries). Major program documents and evaluations consistently describe it as a land reform pilot and not as a graduation program. The asset component is clear—land and farm inputs were provided; and a cash component covered relocation and initial settlement, though not ongoing cash transfers. Thus, it is not a graduation program, but it does provide both cash and productive assets to beneficiaries. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0301-603X2015000100010, https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/153621468279346913/pdf/755560PPAR0P1100Box377378B00PUBLIC0.pdf, https://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/ieg-search?field_report_type_tags_1=1962&search_api_fulltext=&field_topic=All&field_organization_tags=All&type_2_op=not&type_2%5Bexpert%5D=expert&sort_by=search_api_relevance&sort_order=ASC&content_type_1=&field_sub_category=All&f%5B0%5D=country%3A167&f%5B1%5D=topic%3A1&f%5B2%5D=topic%3A5&f%5B3%5D=topic%3A10&f%5B4%5D=topic%3A16&f%5B5%5D=topic%3A2791&f%5B6%5D=topic%3A15629651&f%5B7%5D=topic%3A15629656&f%5B8%5D=topic%3A22996389&f%5B9%5D=topic%3A22996393&f%5B10%5D=topic%3A22996416&f%5B11%5D=topic%3A22996530&f%5B12%5D=topic%3A22996537&f%5B13%5D=topic%3A22996544&f%5B14%5D=topic%3A22996547&f%5B15%5D=topic%3A22996549&f%5B16%5D=topic%3A22996553&f%5B17%5D=topic%3A22996555&f%5B18%5D=topic%3A22996565&f%5B19%5D=topic%3A22996568&f%5B20%5D=topic%3A22996572",
