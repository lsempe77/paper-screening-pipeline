  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'BOMA Project Graduation Program'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The BOMA Project in Kenya uses the 'Graduation Approach', explicitly described as a multi-component, sequenced intervention program for ultra-poor households, and targets women's economic empowerment in arid regions. Official and partner sources describe REAP as a two-year poverty graduation program that provides ultra-poor women with cash grants (seed capital) to launch group enterprises, as well as business training, coaching, and access to savings associations[1][2][3][4][5][6]. The program provides cash transfers—referred to as 'cash grant' or 'seed capital'—as startup funding for small businesses[2][3][6]. The productive assets component is confirmed as the program involves direct support for launching micro-enterprises, which includes both cash and business asset acquisition such as stock and materials required for starting these businesses[1][3][4][6]. These sources also confirm frequent evaluation and scaling with government and multi-lateral partners, further validating its graduation model credentials and multi-component interventions. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.boma.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BOMA-Project-PROFIT-Endline-Report-Key-Findings-Summary.pdf, https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/stocktaking/Prizes/Prizes/Details/15427054467592633, https://www.cgap.org/blog/boma-project-building-resiliency-in-arid-lands",
