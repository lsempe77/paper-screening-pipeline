  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Samata intervention' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Samata is a **multi-component poverty program** (not a graduation program), targeting adolescent girls from scheduled castes/scheduled tribes in northern Karnataka, India, with the primary aim of increasing secondary school enrollment and completion and delaying marriage and sexual debut[1][2][3]. The **core interventions were structural and norms-based**, targeting girls, boys, families, schools, teachers, community leaders, and officials, but **did not focus on ultra/extreme poverty or livelihoods** in the way graduation programs typically do[1][2][3]. There is **no evidence the program provided cash transfers/stipends** to participants; rather, it linked families to existing government schemes (e.g., scholarships) to support girls' education, but uptake of these schemes did not differ by trial arm[1][2]. **No evidence was found that productive assets (e.g., livestock, tools, or business grants) were provided** as part of the intervention[1][2][3]. While Samata is a multi-level, multi-stakeholder intervention, its design and outcomes are distinct from 'graduation' programs (such as those evaluated by BRAC, J-PAL, IPA, or the World Bank), which typically combine cash, assets, training, and coaching for the ultra-poor. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://strive.lshtm.ac.uk/system/files/attachments/Evidence%20brief%20-%20Samata%20intervention%20to%20increase%20secondary%20school%20completion.pdf, https://www.alignplatform.org/resources/samata, https://strive.lshtm.ac.uk/projects/samata-keeping-girls-secondary-school",
