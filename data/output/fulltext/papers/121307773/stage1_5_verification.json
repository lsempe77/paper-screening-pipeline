Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple authoritative sources identify the Atención a Crisis program in Nicaragua (2005-2006) as a multi-component poverty alleviation initiative that piloted a 'graduation' model. According to the study by Macours et al. (2011) and secondary policy analyses, the program provided conditional cash transfers (CCTs) to poor rural households affected by shocks, fulfilling the cash component[2][9]. It also included complementary interventions: households received either vocational training or investment in productive assets alongside the CCT[2]. Evaluations show that the productive investments (assets) and training components enhanced consumption and income, validating the assets component[2][6]. The program design and evaluation literature explicitly connect it to 'graduation' approaches, as detailed in specialized research on multi-faceted poverty reduction programs[6][10]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://repositorio.iep.org.pe/server/api/core/bitstreams/9bd52d3f-9b08-43f8-9678-4d95b969d408/content, https://dds.cepal.org/bpsnc/programa?id=24, https://sites.google.com/view/patrickpremand/ongoing-research",
