  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Nicaragua CCT program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Nicaragua CCT program, known officially as the Red de Protección Social (RPS), is a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program designed to reduce poverty and invest in human capital via regular cash transfers conditional on school attendance and health clinic visits[2][3][4][7]. While the program achieved significant impacts on poverty reduction and schooling, there is no evidence from the available sources that RPS featured a productive assets component typical of 'graduation' approaches (e.g., transfer of livestock, tools, or training for micro-enterprises)[2][3][4][7][8][9]. Graduation programs combine cash with productive asset transfers and mentor support, but all reviewed sources describe only cash stipends and conditionality, not productive assets or multi-component graduation pathways. The World Bank and academic sources also do not indicate productive asset transfer for the Nicaragua CCT program[5][2][9]. Thus, the program is not a graduation program as defined by BRAC/J-PAL standards, and does not provide productive assets. Evidence for cash transfers is strong and direct, with multiple impact evaluations and policy reviews confirming their central role. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://publications.iadb.org/en/more-schooling-and-more-learning-effects-three-year-conditional-cash-transfer-program-nicaragua, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/long-term-effects-conditional-cash-transfer-program-nicaragua, https://econofact.org/can-conditional-cash-transfers-break-the-cycle-of-poverty",
