The program includes major investments in agricultural infrastructure, capacity-building, extension services, and, crucially, matching grants and subsidies to enable farmers to acquire productive assets and adopt new technologies[2]. There is no evidence that the program provided unconditional or conditional cash transfers or stipends directly to participants; rather, its support was in the form of asset-based subsidies and infrastructure[2][1]. The CACS credit scheme under the broader CADP provided credit at concessional rates to enable productive investment, but again, this is not characterized as a typical cash transfer or stipend for poverty alleviation[4]. The literature and official documents do not describe the program as a graduation or ultra-poor targeted program, nor do they reference typical graduation program elements like cash stipends, intensive coaching, or targeting of the ultra-poor[1][6]. Instead, CADP targeted small and medium commercial farmers, not the extreme poor, and focused on agricultural commercialization more broadly. Therefore, CADP is not a graduation program and does not have a pure cash transfer component, but it does provide productive assets and facilitate access to credit and infrastructure. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8176321/, https://irvapp.fbk.eu/projects/detail/impact-evaluation-nigeria-commercial-agriculture-development-project/, https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/236521468096577432",
