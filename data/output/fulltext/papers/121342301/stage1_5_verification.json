  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'ACIAR Pulse Production Project' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Based on official ACIAR project material and related sources, the ACIAR Pulse Production Project in Bangladesh is a research and development initiative aiming to improve smallholder incomes and pulse crop productivity through introducing salt-tolerant varieties, better management practices, and capacity-building for researchers and farmers[2][3][5][6]. There is no mention of the program providing direct cash transfers or stipends to beneficiaries, nor is it described as a 'graduation program' (which typically means a sequenced livelihoods program targeting the ultra-poor with both cash and productive asset transfers, like those implemented by BRAC or IPA)[2][5][7]. While the project does involve introduction of new crop varieties, facilitation of improved seeds through private companies and farmer groups, and agricultural training, evidence of the transfer of productive assets directly to targeted poor households is not clearly documented[2][5]. The program is supported by research and capacity-building efforts, not direct poverty graduation interventions. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.aciar.gov.au/project/cim-2014-076, https://www.aciar.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-04/ACIAR-AOP2024-25-South-Asia-Bangladesh.pdf, https://www.aciar.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-03/2021.03.03_ACIAR-BD_STRAT_DIGI.pdf",
