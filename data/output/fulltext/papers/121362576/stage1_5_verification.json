  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Lesotho Child Grant Programme (CGP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Lesotho Child Grant Programme (CGP) is an unconditional cash transfer scheme that targets poor and vulnerable households with children, aiming to improve child wellbeing through nutrition, education, and health objectives[1][2][4]. CGP provides quarterly cash benefits to eligible households but does not include a core graduation objective or multi-component approach (such as providing productive assets). Stakeholder interviews and program reviews confirm that graduation from poverty is not an explicit or effective outcome of CGP in its original design, and early documents state there was no graduation or exit strategy; households exit the program primarily when children age out or relocate[4]. A graduation model was only piloted much later as part of the separate 'Community Development Model' and 'Cash Plus' pilots, not as a core component of CGP itself[4]. There is also no evidence that CGP provides productive assets directly, though partner initiatives (such as the FAO's Linking Food Security to Social Protection Programme—LFSSP) have piloted the provision of seeds and gardening training to CGP recipients, but this is considered a separate project and not part of CGP's main design[2]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.calpnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lesotho-cgp-pol-options-policy-brief.pdf, https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/lesotho/, https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/39/2/95/7033724",
