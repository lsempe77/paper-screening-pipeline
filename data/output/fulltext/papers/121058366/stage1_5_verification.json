  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'BOMA Project Graduation Program'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources independently confirm that the BOMA Project in Kenya is a graduation program specifically designed for ultra-poor women, following the recognized 'graduation approach' used internationally. The Rural Entrepreneur Access Project (REAP), which is BOMA's core intervention, is described as a two-year poverty graduation program that helps women start small businesses and transition out of extreme poverty[2][3][4][5][1]. The intervention involves sequenced components: participants receive cash transfers (sometimes referred to as cash grants or seed capital) enabling them to launch or grow businesses[2][5][1]. In addition to cash, women receive training and ongoing mentorship. Multiple sources indicate that productive assets are provided—primarily in the form of business start-up capital and resources designed to help participants establish micro-enterprises and savings associations[1][2][3][5]. Evidence from project evaluations and official descriptions specifically mention both cash and asset transfers as components—consistent with standard graduation model practice. The program is recognized and described by respected organizations (CGAP, UNFCCC, Devex, IPA, BRAC) as a graduation program with cash and productive asset components. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.boma.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BOMA-Project-PROFIT-Endline-Report-Key-Findings-Summary.pdf, https://www.cgap.org/blog/boma-project-building-resiliency-in-arid-lands, https://www.devex.com/organizations/the-boma-project-54166",
