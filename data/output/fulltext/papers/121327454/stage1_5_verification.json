  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) is an official Chinese government poverty reduction program launched in 2014-2015[1][4][6]. It involves precise targeting of poor households and provides various support measures tailored to household needs, including direct subsidies, job and employment support, relocation, education, and healthcare[3]. Evidence explicitly shows the use of cash subsidies and performance-based payments (e.g., salary and rewards for reaching income benchmarks, training subsidies), establishing the existence of a cash component[3]. The TPA program also involves provision of productive assets via support for agricultural improvement, infrastructure, relocation (land, housing), and enabling production through local job creation and business development support, which constitutes an assets component[1][4][3]. However, TPA is not a 'graduation program' in the sense developed by BRAC et al. (i.e., a rigorously sequenced, multi-step intervention specifically aimed at the ultra-poor with a graduation endpoint) — TPA covers a much larger, less systematically selected population with a focus on poverty line achievement rather than sustainable graduation from extreme poverty[1]. Multiple evaluations and overviews confirm that TPA is both multi-component and widely targeted, but not an ultra-poor graduation program as defined in the global literature. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://www.china-ces.org/Files/3058abstract/202412170201434113.pdf, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/05/Xie_Presentation-Lunyu-XIE1.pdf",
