  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Multiple social safety net programs'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources confirm that the Graduation Approach—originating from BRAC and promoted globally by organizations such as J-PAL, UNHCR, and World Bank—has been piloted or considered for implementation in Egypt[1][3], Jordan[4], and refugee contexts in the region. The Graduation Approach is defined as a multi-component poverty alleviation program targeting ultra-poor or vulnerable households, typically including:\n\n- Cash transfers or consumption support to meet basic needs during the intervention period[1][3][6]\n- Provision of productive assets (such as livestock, petty trade inputs, or business capital) to help households establish sustainable income sources[1][3][4][6]\n- Additional services such as training, coaching, savings facilitation, and linkage to community or government resources[1][4][5][6]\n\nThe evidence shows explicit provision of cash support and productive assets in Egypt (see J-PAL evaluation[1]) and among refugee populations in Egypt (UNHCR[3]). For Jordan, the RYSE project and associated literature refer to Graduation programs including asset transfer and livelihoods support and various pilots are underway or planned by international organizations[4]. While the term “multiple social safety net programs” is generic, the sources verify that the Graduation Approach (often nested under broader social safety nets or piloted as part of larger social protection reform efforts) is active or under evaluation in Egypt and Jordan; no direct evidence of full national Graduation programs in Tunisia or Morocco was found, but both countries are referenced in policy literature reviewing regional Graduation approaches and active pilots are likely in the humanitarian sector. No single official program name is found spanning all countries, but the Graduation Approach is the validated model present in available data. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/graduating-ultra-poor-egypt, https://www.decentjobsforyouth.org/commitment/68, https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/barriers-and-opportunities-use-graduation-model-jordan",
