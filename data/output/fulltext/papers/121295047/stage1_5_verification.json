Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia is widely documented as a large-scale, multi-component social protection program that incorporates graduation elements. Multiple sources, including CGAP, IFPRI, and peer-reviewed literature, confirm that (1) Ethiopia has layered graduation pilots and approaches onto the PSNP to promote sustainable livelihoods, modeled on the BRAC graduation approach and supported by organizations like the World Bank and BRAC[1][2][3]. As for cash transfers, PSNP has a core component providing regular, predictable cash (and sometimes food) transfers to eligible poor and food-insecure households[2][3]. The program also encompasses a productive assets component: households participate in public works (often infrastructure or environmental programs) and may receive targeted support for productive assets or livelihoods to help them build resilience and eventually 'graduate' from food insecurity and program dependency[2][3][5]. Synthesizing across several program evaluations and research papers, there is strong consensus about these features, though the implementation and success of the graduation pathways is subject to ongoing challenge and mixed results, as noted in IFPRI and academic reviews[2][3][5]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://essp.ifpri.info/2025/10/13/graduating-from-ethiopias-productive-safety-net-programme-what-have-we-learned/, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/dpr.12515",
