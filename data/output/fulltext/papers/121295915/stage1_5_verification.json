Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia is explicitly recognized as a graduation or multi-component poverty reduction program. The structure and literature indicate that the program is designed not only to provide social protection but also to promote participants' graduation from extreme poverty through a combination of interventions. The PSNP includes regular cash or food transfers to support immediate food security, which is clearly documented in multiple implementation and evaluation reports. Graduation criteria for participants include, among other things, the accumulation of productive assets and income. There is consistent reference to both direct cash (or food) support and interventions to promote asset accumulation (e.g., livestock, improved agricultural inputs). NGO-led pilot graduation models integrated with PSNP have demonstrated increased asset and income accumulation. The program guidance and evaluations stress asset accumulation as a key secondary objective, and local administrative procedures for graduation use asset holdings as part of their criteria [2][3][4][6]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://essp.ifpri.info/2025/10/13/graduating-from-ethiopias-productive-safety-net-programme-what-have-we-learned/, https://www.care.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spir_learning_brief-sustainability_of_psnp_household_graduation-final_0.pdf, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/dpr.12515",
