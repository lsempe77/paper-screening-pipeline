  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'China's fourth round poverty alleviation program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: China's fourth round of poverty alleviation program, implemented officially from 2012 to 2020, is not a 'graduation' program as commonly defined in development economics (multi-component, time-bound interventions modeled after BRAC’s approach targeting the ultra-poor to move them toward sustainable livelihoods). Instead, it is a large-scale, government-driven, regionally-targeted poverty reduction campaign, most intensively implemented in 14 contiguous destitute areas (CDAs). However, evidence from academic evaluations and World Bank reviews shows the program included both cash transfers and productive asset support:\n- The program involved 'precise poverty alleviation' projects: local authorities identified poor households, created archive cards, and targeted assistance, including cash allowances and monetary support for household consumption and basic needs[2][5][7].\n- Asset support was a significant component: these projects included the distribution of agricultural inputs (e.g., seeds, livestock), small-scale infrastructure, livelihood projects, and funds for business start-up or agricultural improvement, aligning with the distribution of productive assets[2][6][7].\nAlthough it was highly targeted and multi-component, the overall strategic focus and lack of a staged, time-bound 'graduation' path and close technical guidance from BRAC/J-PAL-style evaluation put it outside 'graduation program' definitions. The cash and assets components are well documented in policy reports and impact assessments. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: http://ccap.pku.edu.cn/docs/2025-01/20250109102008230346.pdf, https://www.idcpc.gov.cn/english2023/dzwk/zgkx/202307/P020230717028601583808.pdf, https://www.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajae.12495",
