  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program in China is not structured as a graduation program in the sense used by BRAC or other ultra-poor programs, which typically combine time-bound cash transfers, assets, training, and follow-up with a clear graduation threshold[3][6]. The TPA program is instead a comprehensive, multi-component national poverty reduction strategy implemented since 2013/2015 to eradicate extreme poverty by targeting specific needs for identified poor households through a wide range of interventions. Evidence confirms the existence of a CASH component: one example listed is direct monetary subsidies (e.g., training subsidies, salary rewards, income support)[3]. There is also evidence for an ASSETS component: the program provides productive assets through measures such as public job creation, relocation into new housing, educational investments, and infrastructure improvements, as well as productive asset transfers when identified as needed (e.g., farming inputs, tools, relocation into new homes, support for setting up small businesses)[3]. Therefore, the TPA is best classified as a multi-component poverty alleviation initiative, not a classical graduation program, but it includes both cash and productive assets as critical components. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.china-ces.org/Files/3058abstract/202412170201434113.pdf, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/05/Xie_Presentation-Lunyu-XIE1.pdf, https://sccei.fsi.stanford.edu/china-briefs/how-participation-chinas-poverty-alleviation-campaign-affected-firm-performance-and",
