It provided ultra-poor participants with either cash or food transfers, and in some treatment arms, combined transfers with behavioral change communication (BCC). There is no evidence TMRI included the transfer of productive assets, such as livestock or business start-up kits, nor other typical graduation components like savings facilitation or intensive coaching. TMRI is not described as a graduation program in published studies—it did not feature asset transfers or the comprehensive package required by the 'graduation' approach (which typically requires at least three of five core components: cash/food transfers, productive asset transfer, savings/credit access, training, and coaching). All key sources agree TMRI is a cash and food transfer intervention, not a graduation program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://bangladesh.ifpri.info/transfer-modality-research-initiative-tmri/, https://voxdev.org/topic/health/how-programme-design-and-local-context-shape-lasting-effects-cash-and-food-transfers, https://poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/2024-10/Executive%20Summary%20Designing%20Cash%20Transfers%20and%20Graduation%20Programs.pdf",
