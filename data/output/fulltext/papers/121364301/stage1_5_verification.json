  "assessment": "NO",
  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Water User Association (WUA)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: There is no evidence, from either direct official sources or secondary research, that Water User Associations (WUA) in Ghana constitute a graduation or multi-component poverty program. WUAs generally refer to community groups organized to manage irrigation, water access, or infrastructure, particularly for agriculture. None of the reviewed sources indicate that Ghanaian WUAs are structured like graduation programs (such as the BRAC Ultra-Poor Graduation model) which combine cash transfers, asset transfers, and holistic livelihood support. No information was found linking WUAs in Ghana to cash transfer stipends or the distribution of productive assets. References to 'graduation' in search findings (e.g., [3]) pertain to organizational accomplishments, such as the end of a training or leadership cycle, not to economic graduation out of poverty. Furthermore, major international and Ghanaian development documentation on poverty graduation and productive asset transfer programs do not mention WUAs in this context. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/04/Lamia-Rashid-BRAC-Ultrapoor-Graduation-Paper-for-UN-Expert-Group-Meeting-May-2017-25Apr17.pdf, https://mofa.gov.gh/site/components-eugap, https://www.iwmi.org/where-we-work/ghana/",
