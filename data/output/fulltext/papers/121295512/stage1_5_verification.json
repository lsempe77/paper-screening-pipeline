  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Millennium Villages Project (MVP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Millennium Villages Project (MVP) in Kenya was a large-scale, multi-sectoral rural development initiative that targeted extreme poverty through integrated interventions across sectors such as agriculture, health, education, infrastructure, and business development. It is not classified as a graduation program in the sense used by BRAC, IPA, or similar actors (i.e., a sequenced model combining cash transfers, productive asset transfers, training, coaching, etc., explicitly aiming for ultra-poor graduation)[3][2]. The MVP provided material support such as seeds, fertilizers, livestock, training, and microcredit/cooperative support, which qualify as 'productive assets,' but there is no direct evidence that MVP implemented cash transfer or stipend components as a systematic feature of its model[1][3][2]. The 'graduation' referenced in MVP documents typically refers to school completion, not a poverty graduation approach. The MVP predates or runs largely parallel to the formalization and evaluation of 'graduation' program models, and distinguishes itself through its multi-component, integrated approach, not through a targeted graduation pathway for the ultra-poor. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.millenniumpromise.org/millenniumvillages, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Villages_Project, https://studio.edx.org/asset-v1:SDGAcademyX+ASD001+1T2020+type@asset+block@Millenium_Villages_Project_Report_2011-b.pdf",
