  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Social Entrepreneurship Program (SEP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Based on recent academic and government sources, the Social Entrepreneurship Program (SEP) in Indonesia was launched in 2020 by the Ministry of Social Affairs and targets poor families, particularly those who previously received conditional assistance programs. The program aims to improve economic income and restore welfare, with evidence indicating increased family income among beneficiaries[1][2][3]. However, the SEP is characterized as a poverty alleviation initiative with a focus on economic empowerment through social entrepreneurship and business activities, rather than an integrated graduation program built on the classic multi-component model (such as those developed by BRAC, which explicitly combine cash transfers, asset endowment, training, and mentoring as core components)[8]. There is no clear evidence in available sources that SEP systematically provides cash transfers or productive assets as direct program components—descriptions emphasize increases in income and small business activities, but do not specify the transfer of cash or assets as programmatic elements. SEP is not described as a 'graduation program' in academic literature or official documents, nor does it follow the multi-component graduation model being piloted in Indonesia under different initiatives[5][6][8]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://knepublishing.com/index.php/KnE-Social/article/download/14258/22996/71103, https://kneopen.com/KnE-Social/article/view/14258/13218/, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10040643/",
