  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program in China is a large-scale, multi-pronged government initiative started in 2013–2014 to end absolute poverty by 2020. It uses a broad set of measures, including identifying poor households, providing financial subsidies, vocational training, public employment, relocation, and improved access to education and healthcare. Multiple sources confirm the delivery of cash and in-kind subsidies (such as performance-based wage subsidies for working in 'poverty alleviation factories', financial support for participating in skills training, and conditional rewards for employment), which amount to a structured cash transfer component[3]. In addition, the program provides productive assets: case studies note households receiving livestock, agricultural tools, or priority access to collective land and resources as part of targeted support packages, which are direct provisions of productive assets[3]. Although the TPA incorporates multi-component support and aims for sustainable livelihood improvement, it does not strictly follow the 'graduation' model as defined by BRAC or J-PAL—involving a sequenced approach with mandatory consumption support, assets, intensive coaching, and exit benchmarks. Instead, it acts as a broad anti-poverty platform with diverse modalities chosen based on local context. No rigorous evidence was found that TPA incorporates all the defining elements and sequencing of a graduation approach. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://www.china-ces.org/Files/3058abstract/202412170201434113.pdf, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/05/Xie_Presentation-Lunyu-XIE1.pdf",
