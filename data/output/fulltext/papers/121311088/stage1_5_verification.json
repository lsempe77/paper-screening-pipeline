  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'New Hope Project' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The New Hope Project, evaluated rigorously by MDRC, was a U.S.-based multi-year anti-poverty initiative in Milwaukee during the late 1990s. It provided full-time workers below poverty with earnings supplements (effectively cash transfers), childcare subsidies, and health insurance, along with access to temporary community service jobs for those needing work. However, the program is not considered a 'graduation program' in the sense used for ultra-poor livelihoods interventions (e.g. BRAC, CGAP, IPA, World Bank), which include sequenced asset transfers, training, and wraparound support designed for the ultra-poor to 'graduate' to sustainable livelihoods. The New Hope Project did not provide productive assets (such as livestock, equipment, or capital specific for small businesses) as a primary intervention; rather, it focused on employment supports, cash income supplements, and family services. The formal evaluations do not mention an asset transfer component typical of graduation programs. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.mdrc.org/work/publications/long-term-effects-new-hope-childrens-academic-achievement-and-achievement/file-full, https://www.mdrc.org/publication/effects-new-hope-children-and-adults-8-years-after-program-ended-summary-findings, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hope_(Wisconsin_experiment)",
