  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Trickle Up (TU) Graduation Program'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Trickle Up Graduation Program in India is explicitly described as a graduation (multi-component) program designed to support ultra-poor households, notably women, to move out of extreme poverty. According to Trickle Up's own documentation and several evaluations, the program components include consumption support (small cash stipends), regular coaching and monitoring, linkage to savings groups, technical and livelihood training, and notably, direct transfer of productive assets (seed capital grants) to participants. In a Ford Foundation evaluation, the program involved seed capital grant transfers of Rs. 11,280 (~$205) and two months of consumption support, clearly fulfilling both the cash transfers and productive assets criteria. Participants are enabled to develop sustainable livelihoods through a sequenced approach, and the program is highlighted as a model graduation intervention in India. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://trickleup.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ApproachGraduation_2017_02.pdf, https://trickleup.org/graduation_india/, https://www.findevgateway.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/ford-eval-final-4-pager.pdf",
