  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), now known as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), is not a graduation or multi-component poverty program in the sense used by organizations like BRAC, IPA, or J-PAL. Graduation programs typically provide a holistic package of support including cash transfers, productive assets, training, and follow-up with the aim of moving ultra-poor households sustainably out of poverty. MGNREGS is a workfare-based social protection scheme guaranteeing 100 days of wage employment per year to rural households demanding work[2][1][5]. It does not specifically target the ultra-poor or deliver multi-component interventions; rather, it provides public works and associated wages. However, it does have a cash component: beneficiaries receive wage payments for unskilled manual labor, which qualifies as cash transfers[2][1][6]. Additionally, the program results in the creation of durable assets (such as roads, canals, ponds, and wells) in rural areas as a secondary objective[2][1]. The assets are public, not private, but the asset component is integral to the program's official design. Evidence does not support its classification as a graduation program. The name and official documentation confirm the scheme: Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi_National_Rural_Employment_Guarantee_Act,_2005, https://haryanarural.gov.in/mahatma-gandhi-national-rural-employment-guarantee-scheme-mgnregs/, https://nrega.nic.in",
