  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Gerbang Sadu Mandara (GSM)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Gerbang Sadu Mandara (GSM) is confirmed as a program developed by the Province of Bali aimed at accelerating poverty reduction, with a strong emphasis on 'integrated village development', community empowerment, and increasing productive economic activities at the village level. Evidence shows GSM focuses on developing village infrastructure and productive economic enterprises ('pengembangan usaha ekonomi produktif di perdesaan')—which indicates the provision of productive assets or support for local enterprise development[2]. GSM collaborates with village-owned enterprises (BUMDes), further supporting this asset-related component[3]. However, there is no explicit mention in any sourced material of GSM providing direct cash transfers or stipends to beneficiaries. Similarly, while GSM has some characteristics of a multi-component poverty intervention, it is not specifically described as a 'graduation program' in the sense used by BRAC or similar models—that is, offering sequenced support including time-bound cash transfers, asset transfers, coaching, and health components. The available sources do not clarify the presence or absence of a dedicated cash transfer or stipend component. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: MEDIUM | Sources: https://dispmd.bulelengkab.go.id/informasi/detail/artikel/gerbang-sadu-mandara-49, http://download.garuda.kemdikbud.go.id/article.php?article=1000852&title=ORIENTASI+KEWIRAUSAHAAN+NILAI-NILAI+BUDAYA+DAN+KINERJA+BADAN+USAHA+MILIK+DESA+DI+KABUPATEN+BULELENG&val=11394",
