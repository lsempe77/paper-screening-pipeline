  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Child Development Grant Program (CDGP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Child Development Grant Programme (CDGP) in Nigeria is a UK DFID-funded pilot that delivers unconditional cash transfers to pregnant women and women with children under two years old, aiming to reduce poverty, hunger, and malnutrition in Zamfara and Jigawa states. The program’s two components are: (1) an unconditional cash transfer and (2) a counselling and behavior change campaign focused on maternal and child health. There is no evidence from official program documentation or external impact evaluations that CDGP provides productive assets, livelihood support, or implements the multi-component, sequenced package typical of 'graduation' programs (such as those based on the BRAC model, which combine cash, assets, skills training, mentoring, and access to services). The CDGP is a cash transfer program focused on improving child nutrition and maternal well-being by addressing economic and behavioral barriers, not a graduation or multi-component livelihoods intervention. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/child-development-grants-programme-nigeria, https://poverty-action.org/nigeria-graduation-roundtable-sharing-lessons-and-charting-way-forward, https://www.fundsforngos.org/all-proposals/a-sample-proposal-breaking-the-chains-of-poverty-through-education-in-nigeria/",
