  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Head Start' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Head Start in the United States is an early childhood education and development program for low-income families that provides preschool education, health, nutrition, parental involvement, and social services[5][8]. Head Start aims to break the cycle of poverty by supporting school readiness and healthy development, showing long-term positive effects such as reduced adult poverty and increased educational attainment among participants[1][2][3][7]. However, it is not classified as a 'graduation' or 'multi-component poverty graduation' program in the sense used by the BRAC or CGAP-Led graduation approach: it does not include sequenced economic inclusion interventions such as direct cash transfers, productive asset transfers, or intensive livelihood coaching. There is no evidence in the cited materials or authoritative reports that Head Start provides regular cash stipends, lump-sum cash transfers, or direct transfers of productive assets for household economic activities. The supports provided are in-kind (such as meals, educational materials, health services), not cash or assets transfers. Its impact on poverty reduction is via human capital development, not through direct economic inclusion measures. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://acf.gov/ohs/about/head-start, https://www.nber.org/digest/202104/evaluating-head-start-program-disadvantaged-children, https://www.ffyf.org/resources/2019/01/new-study-shows-head-start-reduces-likelihood-of-adult-poverty/",
