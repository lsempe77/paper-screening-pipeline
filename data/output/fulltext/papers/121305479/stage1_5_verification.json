  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Bangladesh Poultry Model'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Evidence shows that the Bangladesh 'Poultry Model' refers to a component of the broader BRAC Ultra-Poor Graduation Program, internationally recognized as a graduation approach. The program targets the ultra-poor and provides a multifaceted package: it includes a transfer of productive assets (including poultry such as chickens and ducks), technical training, and regular cash or food support as consumption support. J-PAL, BRAC, and peer-reviewed research confirm the inclusion of both productive asset transfers (specifically poultry is mentioned extensively) and cash/consumption support. Multiple sources and academic evaluations define this as the archetypal graduation program, and studies of the poultry-focused branch verify the provision of poultry assets with corresponding training and cash transfers. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/targeting-ultra-poor-improve-livelihoods, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/04/Lamia-Rashid-BRAC-Ultrapoor-Graduation-Paper-for-UN-Expert-Group-Meeting-May-2017-25Apr17.pdf, https://www.bracusa.org/solutions/development/poverty/ultra-poor-graduation/",
