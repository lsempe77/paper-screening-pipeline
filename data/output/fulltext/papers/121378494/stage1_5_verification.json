Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources—including IFPRI and project implementers World Vision and ACTED—confirm this is an ultra-poor graduation (UPG) program targeted at IDPs and vulnerable host communities in Baidoa, Somalia. The program is explicitly described as a graduation program[1][2][6][7][8], structured around the UPG model to transition participants out of extreme poverty. Program documentation and beneficiary stories detail the provision of unconditional cash transfers for several cycles as well as the distribution of productive assets, specifically livestock (goats), and livelihood skills training[6]. The combination of multi-purpose cash assistance and productive asset transfer directly matches the core components of a graduation model. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://capacity.ifpri.info/2025/04/02/building-pathways-out-of-poverty-in-baidoa-learning-summit-2025/, https://www.ifpri.org/project/ultra-poor-graduation-in-somalia/, https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstreams/ce9e03fe-d048-4f83-938f-e12551223414/download",
