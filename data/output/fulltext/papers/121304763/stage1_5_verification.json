  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources confirm that the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) is integrating or piloting the Graduation Approach within its framework, especially in partnership with organizations like BRAC International, Trickle Up, and with guidance from J-PAL South Asia. The Graduation Approach, as implemented within NRLM and its variants (at the state level, e.g., Satat Jeevikoparjan Yojana in Bihar), includes multi-component interventions such as productive asset transfers, livelihoods training, and financial inclusion[1][2][3][4][6][8][9]. The official NRLM framework focuses on mobilizing rural poor into self-help groups, improving access to credit and livelihoods, and enabling asset building[1][3][4][7]. However, while the Graduation Approach worldwide typically includes cash or consumption stipends during the asset transfer and training phase, direct evidence that NRLM nationally provides regular cash transfers or stipends remains limited. State Graduation pilots (like SJY) have asset transfer components, and while some case studies mention 'investment value' provided to start businesses, it is not always clear from public documentation if this is a cash grant or in-kind support[2]. Therefore, asset transfer is confirmed, but cash transfer as a routine component is ambiguous. Confidence is high regarding NRLM's graduation-style features and assets provision, but medium on the cash stipend element due to lack of program-wide documentation. | Graduation: YES, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.cgap.org/blog/introducing-graduation-approach-in-indias-jharkhand-state, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/blog/12-13-23/graduation-approach-updated-insights-and-best-practices-scale, https://www.bracinternational.org/global-impact/india/",
