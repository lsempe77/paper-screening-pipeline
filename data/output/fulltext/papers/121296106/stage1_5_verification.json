Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia is cited as one of the largest social protection programs in Africa and features a multi-component design, aiming to not only improve food security but also promote sustainable graduation from extreme poverty. Various sources confirm that the program delivers cash and food transfers to households facing food insecurity[2][3][4]. Furthermore, the PSNP is frequently mentioned in connection with 'graduation' models—structured interventions designed to help extremely poor households build assets, become self-reliant, and ultimately exit from safety net dependence[1][2][3][5]. These models, often piloted in partnership with organizations such as BRAC and the Ford Foundation, include both cash transfers and the provision of productive assets to support livelihood diversification and income generation. Both government-led and NGO-led PSNP graduation approaches have provided assets, credit, and training to participants in addition to regular transfers[1][2]. Multiple academic studies explicitly note the PSNP's dual objectives: short-term consumption smoothing (often via cash) and long-term asset accumulation or productive investments[3][5]. Therefore, the PSNP meets all the verification criteria listed. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://essp.ifpri.info/2025/10/13/graduating-from-ethiopias-productive-safety-net-programme-what-have-we-learned/, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/dpr.12515",
