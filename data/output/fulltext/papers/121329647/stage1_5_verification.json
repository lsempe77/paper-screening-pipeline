  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Food Subsidy Programs' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The term 'Food Subsidy Programs' refers broadly to programs that subsidize food—and are generally structured as social safety net initiatives targeting food security, not as graduation programs. Graduation programs, such as those pioneered by BRAC and implemented globally, are multi-component interventions explicitly designed to move ultra-poor households out of extreme poverty through sequenced support including cash/consumption transfers, productive asset grants, skills training, and coaching[3][4][6][7]. Food subsidy schemes, by contrast, usually center on providing direct or indirect support for food purchases (such as price subsidies or in-kind food distribution) and are not multi-component or designed for graduation from poverty. There is no evidence that generic 'Food Subsidy Programs' deliver productive assets as a core component. Some may include cash transfer elements (for example, food vouchers or cash for food), but these are not universal and are not designed within a graduation framework; the public literature and World Bank evaluation of poverty graduation approaches draw a clear distinction between food aid/food subsidy safety nets and true graduation models[3][4]. Because no specific country or official program name was provided, there is no verified program associated with the generic term 'Food Subsidy Programs'. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2013/04/04/graduation-program-creating-pathways-out-of-extreme-poverty-into-sustainable-livelihoods, https://alleviate-poverty.org/methodology, https://bracupgi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Graduation-and-Food-Security.pdf",
