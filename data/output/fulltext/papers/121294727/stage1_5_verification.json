  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program launched by China in 2014 is the country's largest and most comprehensive anti-poverty campaign to date. It is a multifaceted program which includes measures tailored to the needs of both poor households and counties, ranging from income support, public job creation, relocation, educational subsidies, and agricultural/industrial development. The program is not structured as a 'graduation' program in the sense used by BRAC or IPA/JPAL, which identifies an ultra-poor cohort, provides sequenced interventions (cash, assets, training, etc.), and then tracks graduation out of poverty over a set period following a standardized methodology. Instead, TPA uses a flexible, locally-adapted approach drawing on multiple tools and government financing. Evidence of a cash component exists: TPA provides direct subsidies and cash rewards for employment milestones (e.g. salary subsidies, minimum income guarantees, and EITC-like incentives)[4]. As for productive assets, TPA's local implementation system provides support such as agricultural inputs, industrial project funding, and relocation to better housing for productive purposes[1][4]. Therefore, while it has both cash and productive asset components, it is not a classic 'graduation' program as per international definition. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://voxchina.org/show-3-391.html, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/05/Xie_Presentation-Lunyu-XIE1.pdf, https://sccei.fsi.stanford.edu/china-briefs/how-participation-chinas-poverty-alleviation-campaign-affected-firm-performance-and",
