  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Social Recovery Project (SRP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Social Recovery Project (SRP) in Zambia is listed in multiple official sources, including the World Bank, as a program supporting locally-generated community-based projects focused on infrastructure and service delivery improvements in education, health, water, and sanitation[3][4][5]. None of the accessible descriptions indicate that SRP targets individual ultra-poor households with a graduation approach, nor do they mention direct cash transfers or productive asset provision as would be typical in multi-component poverty graduation programs like BRAC or J-PAL graduation pilots[1][2]. The available evidence points to SRP being a community initiative and infrastructure-focused program rather than a household-level poverty graduation initiative. There is no documentation of cash stipends or individualized asset transfers; the emphasis is on community infrastructure, not livelihoods. While the financing might enable some community economic activities, there is no specific mention of direct support to ultra-poor individuals in the form of cash or assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/671081511189098753/zambia-social-recovery-project, https://www.sidalc.net/search/Record/dig-okr-109869864/Description, https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&type=504&nr=954&men",
