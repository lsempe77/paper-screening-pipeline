The model does not follow the 'graduation' approach typical of BRAC-type ultra-poor livelihood programs, which deliver sequenced cash stipends, training, assets, and support for the ultra-poor with explicit evaluation toward graduation from poverty[1][5][3]. The evidence indicates CWLS primarily finances productive assets (e.g., infrastructure such as traditional markets for small traders, and education programs), but it does not appear to provide direct cash transfers/stipends to individuals for consumption as seen in graduation programs[1][4]. Proceeds from CWLS are used to build markets and provide low-rate financing to traders, rather than direct livelihood asset distributions. There is ambiguity around cash support: while Islamic banks may offer financing, it is asset-linked and not unconditional cash transfers. The program is primarily an asset/productive investment platform with strong financial inclusion and social investment goals, not a graduation model. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://rdis.seo.ir/media/ckeditor_files/2024/05/14/iman-sastra_p6PbKbO.pdf, https://uns.ac.id/en/bwi-national-seminar-encourages-uns-academic-community-to-join-indonesia-waqf-movement/, http://ur.aeu.edu.my/1197/1/Cash%20Waqf%20Linked%20Sukuk%20(CWLS)%20Returns%20and%20Social%20Programs%20in%20Indonesia.pdf",
