  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Child Grant Programme (CGP) and Multiple Category Targeted Programme (MCP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Child Grant Programme (CGP) in Zambia is identified as an unconditional cash transfer program targeting ultra-poor households with young children. Multiple sources confirm CGP provides regular cash transfers to eligible families to supplement income and improve human capital outcomes but do not indicate the direct provision of productive assets. Impact reviews and evaluations specifically state that CGP focuses on reducing extreme poverty through cash, with aims to increase household assets like livestock achieved through recipients' own spending patterns, not the distribution of assets by the program itself[1][2][3][4][5]. There is strong evidence that CGP is not a graduation program: impact analyses find that program benefits dissipate after exit, and scholars conclude that 'cash alone is unlikely to lead to wholesale graduation out of poverty'[4]. The Multiple Category Targeted Programme (MCTG, not MCP) is a related transfer under the same harmonized system, but also centers on cash, not graduation or asset transfer. While a harmonized 'Cash Plus' approach for Zambia offers a graduation-type package elsewhere[6], there is no evidence the CGP or MCP/MCTG are implemented in this manner. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6711746/, https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/zambia/, https://www.fao.org/4/i3692e/i3692e.pdf",
