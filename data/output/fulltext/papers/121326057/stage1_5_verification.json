  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'South African Social Grants Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The South African Social Grants Program is an extensive national social protection system, primarily providing unconditional cash transfers to vulnerable groups including children, the elderly, and the disabled[2][5][6]. Official sources and multiple evaluations confirm the program’s large-scale impact on poverty reduction and inequality through these cash transfers. There is no evidence that the core social grants program itself systematically provides productive assets like livestock, equipment, or seed to beneficiaries, nor does it combine the multi-component 'graduation' package of the BRAC model (which integrates assets, training, coaching, and cash)[2][5][6]. However, a separate, newer pilot named 'Generating Better Livelihoods for Grants Beneficiaries', led by FinMark Trust and BRAC, is specifically trialing a graduation approach for a small subset (currently 370-5000 families) of social grant recipients.[1][4] This pilot aims to add training, coaching, and productive assets to cash beneficiaries and is explicitly described as a graduation program, but it is not representative of the national social grants program. Therefore, the main Social Grants Program is NOT a graduation or multi-component poverty program and does NOT provide productive assets; it is a cash transfer program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/south-africas-welfare-success-story-ii-poverty-reducing-social-grants/, https://www.cgap.org/blog/how-graduation-approach-fits-social-protection-programs, https://asq.africa.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/168/V19I1a3.pdf",
