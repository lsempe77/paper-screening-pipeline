Its primary intervention is the provision of regular, predictable, and unconditional cash transfers to improve consumption, reduce poverty and vulnerability, and enhance resilience against shocks such as droughts. Multiple authoritative sources confirm the regular delivery of unconditional cash (e.g., 5,400 Ksh every two months) to beneficiary households, with scalability to cover additional households during emergencies[3][5]. The program’s objective includes improving nutrition and reducing poverty, with ambitions to ‘graduate’ households from poverty; however, 'graduation' in this context is used as an aspirational goal, not as a structured multi-component graduation approach typical of BRAC or similar models[1][6]. There is no evidence from official descriptions or operations manuals that HSNP directly provides productive assets or livelihoods interventions—a requirement of formal graduation programs. Instead, its impact on assets is indirect via increased household resources from cash transfers, but it does not include asset provision or skills/livelihoods training as core program components[2][3][4][5]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://devtracker.fcdo.gov.uk/programme/GB-GOV-1-300143/summary, https://www.calpnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kenya.pdf, https://www.developmentpathways.co.uk/our-work/building-capacity-for-an-effective-hunger-safety-net-programme/",
