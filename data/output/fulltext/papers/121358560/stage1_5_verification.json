  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Guangdong Province Targeted Poverty Alleviation Policy' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Guangdong Province Targeted Poverty Alleviation Policy is part of China's broader targeted poverty alleviation (TPA) initiative. While it uses a targeted, household-level approach and is multi-sectoral, directly addressing household-specific needs, there is no direct evidence in available sources that it matches the graduation model (which typically integrates time-limited cash transfers, asset transfers, plus coaching and financial inclusion as per the BRAC or J-PAL graduation approach). The main features cited for Guangdong's program include establishing poverty status, individualized support plans, and mobilization of social resources, but there are no detailed, documented components specifically referencing ongoing, unconditional or conditional cash transfers or the systematic provision of productive assets as done in graduation programs[3]. Some sources state that Guangdong's approach avoids a 'project-based' model that simply transfers funds, focusing on mobilization and matching support to needs[3]. It is possible that some households may have received some forms of grants or development support, but there is no clear documentation or evaluation (in the reviewed sources) that cash or asset transfers were structured and delivered as core program elements. Therefore, both the cash and assets components are marked 'UNCLEAR', with a confident 'NO' to the graduation program classification, based on lack of evidence for the defining features of a graduation approach. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: MEDIUM | Sources: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=98785, https://docs.iza.org/dp14674.pdf, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation",
