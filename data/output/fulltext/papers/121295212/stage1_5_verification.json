Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The BRAC Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction (CFPR) program in Bangladesh is widely recognized as the originator and typifying example of the 'graduation' approach for extremely poor households. This approach combines several components—including asset transfers (primarily livestock or goods for income generation)[2][4], cash stipends for basic needs during early participation[3][6], and training—to enable beneficiaries to move towards sustainable livelihoods. Multiple rigorous evaluations and official sources identify CFPR as a multi-component poverty reduction intervention specifically designed to 'graduate' the ultra-poor out of extreme poverty. These sources explicitly confirm both asset transfers and the provision of cash stipends as integral to CFPR’s intervention package. World Bank, BRAC, and academic literature all refer to CFPR as a graduation model (multi-component), with asset transfer and initial cash support as core elements. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2405712, https://bracupgi.org/our-expertise/research/, https://www.bracinternational.org/research-library/impact-and-spillover-effects-of-an-asset-transfer-programme-on-malnutrition/",
