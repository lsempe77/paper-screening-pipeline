  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'World Vision International Graduation Program'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: World Vision International operates 'Ultra-Poor Graduation' programs globally, including in India, as confirmed by the official World Vision Ultra-Poor Graduation Handbook. The handbook describes the approach as comprising 'carefully sequenced interventions' over 18-24 months, specifically labeling it as a Graduation program[1]. The program targets ultra-poor families and is aligned with the BRAC model. According to the handbook, graduation interventions must integrate across four core pillars: social protection, livelihoods promotion, financial inclusion, and social empowerment. Livelihoods promotion under this model specifically includes the provision of productive assets (such as livestock, agricultural inputs, or small business grants), and the financial inclusion pillar generally refers to cash transfers or stipends for basic needs as a core graduation component. This structure and sequencing are standard for graduation programs globally and are directly referenced as minimum standards for any World Vision-branded 'Ultra-Poor Graduation Programme,' including those in India[1][5]. No direct evidence from public-facing websites in India was found listing recent operational details, but the official handbook outlines India as a key implementation country and provides detailed programmatic standards and components. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.wvi.org/sites/default/files/2019-07/WV-BRAC%20Ultra-Poor%20Graduation%20Handbook%20V2_0.pdf, https://www.wvi.org/livelihoods/ultra-poor-graduation",
