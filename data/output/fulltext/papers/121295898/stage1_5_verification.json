  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) and Rural Public Works (RPW)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) in India was a major anti-poverty and livelihood program launched in the late 1970s. Its main features included providing financial and technical assistance and (most importantly) productive assets such as livestock, land, equipment, or toolkits to identified poor rural households to enable self-employment and sustained income. Direct cash transfers or stipends were not a core feature; instead, the program provided assets, often with an associated bank loan and a government subsidy. This is consistent across several authoritative overviews[1][2][3][5][7]. The IRDP does not fit the technical definition of a 'graduation program' as formalized by BRAC and subsequent donors and researchers (which includes a multi-pronged design: consumption support, asset grants, hands-on training, coaching, and savings facilitation over 18 to 24 months, then graduation based on explicit criteria). While the IRDP supported asset creation, skill training, and financial inclusion, it did not have a time-limited, bundled support package with explicit graduation thresholds as in classic graduation programs monitored by J-PAL or the World Bank. Therefore, it was a multi-component poverty program, not a graduation program. There is no evidence of a Rural Public Works (RPW) program as part of IRDP that matches the BRAC or graduation program model—RPW refers to wage employment schemes. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://paytm.com/blog/saving-schemes/government-schemes/objectives-of-integrated-rural-development-program-irdp/, https://codingtag.com/irdp-full-form-integrated-rural-development-programme, https://www.yuvaparivartan.org/irdp/",
