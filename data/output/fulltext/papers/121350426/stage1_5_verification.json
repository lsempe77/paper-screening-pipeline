Multiple sources, including the World Bank and national organizations, consistently describe BDH as a cash transfer program. Its main component is the provision of monetary benefits to beneficiaries, which is explicitly stated in both official and analytical sources[3][4][6][7]. There is no evidence that BDH itself provides productive assets; instead, a related program called 'Crédito de Desarrollo Humano' offers lump-sum loans to promote productive investments and is informally referred to as a 'graduation program' from BDH, but BDH on its own is not designed as a multi-component graduation model that combines cash, asset transfers, training, and other supports[3]. BDH does not have a direct asset transfer component. The related graduation pilot by UNHCR-MIES-HIAS referenced in Ecuador is distinct and targets refugees; it only built upon the cash base of BDH but is not part of BDH itself[2]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/evaluations/world-bank-group-ecuador/chapter-4-complementary-support-improved-social-protection, https://grupofaro.org/analisis/bono-de-desarrollo-humano-en-ecuador/, https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/2459916b-62f7-549e-8361-1e5a346ed171",
