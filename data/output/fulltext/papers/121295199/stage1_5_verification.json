While Feed the Future supports interventions that may intersect with graduation approaches or multidimensional poverty reduction (such as improving agricultural productivity or linking farmers to markets), its core model is not the Graduation Approach as defined in the literature (which requires a time-bound, sequenced package including asset transfer, consumption support, skills training, and close coaching as seen in sources [1][2][6][7][8]). There is no evidence Feed the Future operates these time-bound, explicitly graduation-style programs directly or at scale. Feed the Future may fund pilots or partner with organizations that implement graduation programming, but Feed the Future itself is not classified as a graduation program nor does it have a universal cash or asset transfer component. The available references do not provide sufficient evidence that Feed the Future consistently provides targeted cash transfers or productive assets as programmatic core elements. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R44216/R44216.12.pdf, https://www.acdivoca.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Field-guide-graduation-approach-simplified.pdf, https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2013/04/04/graduation-program-creating-pathways-out-of-extreme-poverty-into-sustainable-livelihoods",
