Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple authoritative sources confirm that the Ultra-Poor Program in India—most notably implemented and evaluated by Bandhan, and supported by organizations like J-PAL and Trickle Up—is an adaptation of the BRAC 'Graduation Approach.' This is a multi-component program designed explicitly to graduate ultra-poor households out of extreme poverty. It provides a package that includes productive asset transfers (such as livestock), consumption support via cash transfers or stipends, skills training, coaching, access to savings, and healthcare support. Rigorous impact evaluations, including RCTs, show large and lasting improvements in income, asset holdings, and food security for participants in India. The cash component is usually provided as regular stipends for a set duration, and the assets component as productive inputs (e.g., livestock). | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/targeting-ultra-poor-improve-livelihoods, https://poverty-action.org/graduating-ultra-poor-india, https://trickleup.org/reaching-ultrapoor-india/",
