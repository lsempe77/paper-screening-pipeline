I've extracted what information was available, but many fields are null or limited due to the nature of the content provided. The program appears to be an ultra-poor program in India (based on references to Rupees) that included asset transfers (livestock/poultry) based on the impact analysis tables, but full program details are likely in earlier sections not provided in this excerpt."
