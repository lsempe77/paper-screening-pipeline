  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: TMRI (Transfer Modality Research Initiative) is a safety net pilot implemented in Bangladesh by IFPRI and WFP from 2012 to 2014. It was designed as a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of different transfer modalities for the ultra-poor, specifically mothers of children under two. TMRI provided monthly cash or equal-value food transfers, with or without a nutrition behavior change communication (BCC) component. There is no evidence in the literature that the program includes a productive asset transfer (such as livestock or business capital), which is a central feature of the 'graduation' approach (as pioneered by BRAC) that combines assets, skills training, consumption support, and coaching to promote sustainable livelihoods. TMRI focused on cash and food transfers, nutrition education, and related outcomes, but did not include the multi-component support package or asset transfer typical of graduation programs. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.ifpri.org/project/transfer-modality-research-initiative-tmri/, https://voxdev.org/topic/health/how-programme-design-and-local-context-shape-lasting-effects-cash-and-food-transfers, https://bangladesh.ifpri.info/transfer-modality-research-initiative-tmri/",
