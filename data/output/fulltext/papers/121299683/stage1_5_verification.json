  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Newcastle Disease Vaccine Rural Delivery Programme' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Newcastle Disease Vaccine Rural Delivery Programme in Nigeria focuses on delivering Newcastle Disease (ND) vaccines to rural poultry farmers to reduce poultry mortality and support poverty alleviation[1][2][3][6]. Its core intervention is providing ND vaccines and veterinary services to rural areas to improve the livelihoods of smallholder poultry farmers, especially women. There is no evidence in the available sources that this program follows a graduation model (such as BRAC or Targeting the Ultra-Poor), nor does it offer direct cash transfers or stipends to participants[1][2][3][6]. The program's main approach involves market-based distribution of vaccines and efforts to build local demand and business cases for private delivery channels. The provision of ND vaccines may be considered a 'productive asset' as it directly improves the health and productivity of poultry, which are key income-generating assets for poor rural households. However, sources do not explicitly refer to the vaccines themselves as assets transferred as part of an asset-based ultra-poor graduation approach, so this is best marked as 'UNCLEAR.' | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pindfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Traditional-Poultry-Strategy-Brief.pdf, https://atpsnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Final_Technical_Report_of_the_Market_Scoping_Study_of_Newcastle_Disease_in_Village_Poultry_in_Nigeria_and_Ghana.pdf, https://www.echocommunity.org/en/resources/fb610be0-9fa4-4bf5-8cf4-49dbd12b17f8",
