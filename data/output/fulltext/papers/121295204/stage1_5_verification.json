While graduation—meaning households becoming self-reliant and food secure—is an explicit ambition and benchmark within the program, core PSNP Public Works by itself is not a structured 'graduation program' akin to the sequenced, multi-component BRAC Graduation model; instead, the PSNP is a social safety net with graduation as a long-term outcome. Targeted graduation pilots in Ethiopia (often implemented by NGOs in partnership with PSNP) have included asset transfers, livelihood training, and savings as additional components; however, the government-implemented PSNP Public Works mainly delivers cash (or food) in exchange for labor and invests in community public works, not direct productive asset transfers to individuals. Government documentation and multiple independent evaluations confirm routine cash transfers are central, while direct provision of productive assets is not a standard PSNP Public Works feature. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://capacity4dev.europa.eu/projects/project_psnp_ethiopia_en, https://www.ids.ac.uk/projects/ethiopia-productive-safety-net-programme/, https://essp.ifpri.info/2025/10/13/graduating-from-ethiopias-productive-safety-net-programme-what-have-we-learned/",
