  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Poverty Gap Analysis' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Based on a comprehensive review of available sources, 'Poverty Gap Analysis' in Belgium, Denmark, and the United Kingdom refers to a form of poverty measurement or research rather than a specific poverty alleviation program. It is primarily an analytical tool used to assess the depth and distribution of poverty, not a graduation or multi-component program providing direct support such as cash transfers or productive assets to beneficiaries. While the search results detail graduation approaches and social protection programs globally, there is no evidence that 'Poverty Gap Analysis' in these countries is an operational program corresponding to the graduation model, nor does it involve direct provision of cash or assets to households. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a graduation or multi-component poverty program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.lisdatacenter.org/wps/liswps/205.pdf, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08caae5274a31e000135c/PovertyFocusFinalRep.pdf",
