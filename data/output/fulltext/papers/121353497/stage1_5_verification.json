  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Brazilian Agrarian Reform' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The 'Brazilian Agrarian Reform' refers to a long-standing policy and set of government initiatives focused on land redistribution and rural development in Brazil, primarily led by INCRA (the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform). Its core aim is the redistribution of land to landless families, provision of productive agricultural land, and resettlement. While beneficiaries often receive access to land (a productive asset) and sometimes technical support or access to rural credit, the program does not systematically follow the graduation approach as defined in the literature (multi-component interventions purposefully sequencing cash/asset transfer, training, coaching, savings, and health support to generate sustainable exits from extreme poverty). There is no robust evidence that suggests the program contains regular cash transfers or stipends as a formal component akin to graduation models, though some credit or social benefits may be accessible. The assets component is verified by the direct provision of land. The program's objectives are primarily agrarian socio-economic inclusion, not explicit graduation from ultra-poverty following a structured, evidence-based model like BRAC or those described in the referenced literature. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform_in_Brazil, https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100038615, https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2020/03/17/land-reform-in-brazil",
