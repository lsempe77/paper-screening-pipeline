  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'FAARM (Food and Agricultural Approaches to Reducing Malnutrition)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The FAARM program in Bangladesh is primarily an agricultural and nutrition intervention designed to reduce malnutrition through home gardens, poultry rearing, and nutrition education. According to multiple sources, including peer-reviewed research (e.g., Hoddinott et al., 'Food and Agricultural Approaches to Reducing Malnutrition (FAARM) trial in Bangladesh'), FAARM provides tangible productive assets such as seeds, agricultural tools, chickens, and training, but it does not include cash transfers or stipends, nor is it structured as a multi-component 'graduation' program for the ultra-poor as defined by BRAC's Ultra Poor Graduation framework. Graduation programs feature cash/consumption support and asset transfers as core components, often targeting ultra-poor with a pathway to self-reliance; FAARM, while similar in some asset interventions, does not include a cash or stipend element and does not meet all graduation protocol criteria. This is supported by documentation on FAARM interventions and the definition of graduation programs by BRAC, IPA, and the World Bank. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02505711, https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09274-0, https://poverty-action.org/ultra-poor-graduation-approach",
