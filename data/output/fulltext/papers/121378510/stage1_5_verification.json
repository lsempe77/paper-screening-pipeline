Internet search found graduation programs in Ethiopia: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources detail the implementation of graduation model social protection programs in Ethiopia, often as pilots or subcomponents linked to the national Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP). The International Food Policy Research Institute documents an experimental graduation program at scale in Ethiopia that combines livelihood programming, savings groups, value-chain training, and direct support for ultra-poor households[4]. The intervention includes both cash transfers (sometimes described as livelihood grants) and productive asset transfers, such as in-kind poultry grants[4]. The CGAP-Ford Foundation Graduation Program, which included pilots in Ethiopia, lists asset transfers, consumption support (usually provided as cash transfers), savings, and coaching as its core components[2]. These program designs are consistent with other impact evaluations and synthesis from IPA, IFPRI, and World Bank sources, all describing graduation model programs in Ethiopia as multilayered approaches targeting the ultra-poor with both cash and productive asset components[1][6]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://poverty-action.org/graduating-ultra-poor-ethiopia, https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2013/04/04/graduation-program-creating-pathways-out-of-extreme-poverty-into-sustainable-livelihoods, https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/732179",
