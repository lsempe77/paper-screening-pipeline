  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Urban Program on Livelihoods and Income Fortification and Socio-civic Transformation (UPLIFT)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: No authoritative source verifies the existence of an 'Urban Program on Livelihoods and Income Fortification and Socio-civic Transformation (UPLIFT)' operating as a graduation or multi-component poverty program in Uganda. None of the search results from reputable agencies (such as J-PAL, IPA, BRAC, or Ugandan government social protection sources) describe or evaluate a program matching this name. Some similarly named programs (e.g., 'UPLIFT West Nile' or 'Uplift A Village') exist, but these are not confirmed to be associated with national graduation approaches or large-scale cash transfer or asset provision interventions targeting ultra-poor urban populations in Uganda. While graduation models are being implemented in Uganda and are well-documented (see [1], [2], [3], [7]), there is no evidence that the specific UPLIFT program described here is one of them, nor confirmation that it delivers cash transfers or productive assets. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: LOW | Sources: https://inclusivefutures.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Disability-inclusive-ultra-poor-graduation-in-Uganda_edited-Mar24.pdf, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXZF9Szgup8, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/targeting-ultra-poor-improve-livelihoods",
