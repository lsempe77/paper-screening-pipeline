  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Suubi+Adherence' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Suubi+Adherence is a Ugandan intervention aimed at adolescents living with HIV, designed as an economic empowerment and financial stability model to support treatment adherence, not a graduation program for poverty alleviation. Graduation programs, as defined by leading organizations, are multi-component interventions targeting ultra-poor households with a combination of cash or asset transfers, training, coaching, and financial inclusion, typically for livelihoods development and extreme poverty exit[[1][4]]. The Suubi+Adherence intervention combines a matched savings account, financial education, health education, and support for income-generating activities (IGAs), explicitly aiming to improve ART adherence and long-term stability among HIV-positive youth[[2][5][7]]. Documentation specifies matched savings, financial education, and support for IGAs, indicating the provision of both cash (savings, transfers) and productive assets or capital (support for IGAs and microenterprise)[[2][5][7]]. However, the target is narrow (HIV-positive adolescents) and the primary goal is medical adherence, not ultra-poor graduation; thus, it does not fit the standard definition of a graduation program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://ichad.wustl.edu/suubiadherence/, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9657112/, https://www.wisdomlib.org/science/journal/international-journal-of-environmental-research-and-public-health-mdpi/d/doc1746909.html",
