This is a policy analysis about micro-finance, not an evaluation of a graduation or cash+asset transfer program\n2. The paper discusses micro-finance (loans), which is not the same as cash transfers\n3. There is no evidence of productive asset transfers\n4. The paper appears to be analyzing policy and institutional arrangements rather than evaluating a specific intervention"
