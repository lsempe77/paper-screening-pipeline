Numerous studies, including Besley and Burgess (2000), confirm significant poverty reduction associated with land reform, primarily by increasing beneficiaries' access to agricultural land and productive assets. There is no evidence these programs included formal cash transfers or stipends as part of their intervention. Instead, the asset-transfer was the allocation of land itself, constituting a transfer of productive capital but not of cash. Graduation programs, in the technical sense (as defined by BRAC, IPA, World Bank, etc.), are explicitly multi-component interventions typically including cash stipends, asset transfers, mentoring, and sometimes health or education services. There is no evidence that India's land reform programs followed this model; they were, fundamentally, redistributive asset-transfer initiatives focused on land. Although both approaches target poverty, land reform in India did not structurally incorporate the comprehensive package of 'graduation' interventions. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/115/2/389/1840440, http://cpi.stanford.edu/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Besley%20and%20Burgess_2000_Land,%20Housing,%20and%20Homelessness.pdf, https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/Assets/Documents/personal-pages/robin-burgess/land-reform-poverty-reduction-growth.pdf",
