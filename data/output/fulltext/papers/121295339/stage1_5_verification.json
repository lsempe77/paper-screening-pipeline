  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Pastoralist Areas Resilience Improvement through Market Expansion (PRIME)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The 'Pastoralist Areas Resilience Improvement through Market Expansion (PRIME)' program in Ethiopia is primarily focused on strengthening resilience among pastoral communities through market and value chain development, natural resource management, and enhancing livelihoods in arid and semi-arid lands. PRIME is implemented by a consortium led by Mercy Corps and funded by USAID, and its documentation (including USAID and implementer project descriptions) consistently describe interventions such as livestock health, market access, climate risk management, and nutrition—not graduation programming per the 'CGAP-Ford Foundation Graduation Approach' or similar ultra-poor graduation models. Graduation programs have core elements like time-bound cash transfers/consumption support, significant asset transfers, livelihoods coaching, and targeting the ultra-poor, usually referenced as part of the 'graduation approach' pioneered in Bangladesh or implemented in Ethiopia by REST, PSNP, or similar. There is no credible evidence from project documents or major research organizations linking PRIME to providing cash transfers or structured asset transfers as part of a comprehensive graduation package. The graduation pilot and PSNP expansion are unrelated to PRIME.[4][5][6][1][2][10] | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.usaid.gov/ethiopia/fact-sheets/us-government-assistance-resilience-pastoralist-prime, https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-pastoralist-areas-resilience-improvement-through-market-expansion-prime, https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAD288.pdf",
