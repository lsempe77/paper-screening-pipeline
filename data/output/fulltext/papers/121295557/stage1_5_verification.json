  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) 1000' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: LEAP 1000 is Ghana’s flagship social cash transfer program targeting extremely poor households with young children, orphans and vulnerable children, the destitute elderly, and persons with acute disabilities. It provides regular cash payments to eligible families, as explicitly stated in program documentation and evaluation reports[4][6]. There is no evidence in the available program evaluations, baseline reports, or official communications that LEAP 1000 includes asset transfers or productive input packages, distinguishing it from graduation programs (such as those piloted by BRAC or J-PAL), which combine cash with assets, training, and coaching. LEAP 1000 is a single-component (cash transfer) social protection program, not a multi-component graduation approach[3][4]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/LEAP-1000-Baseline-Report_2016.pdf, https://bettercarenetwork.org/sites/default/files/LEAPKARAGAPUBLISHED.pdf, https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/document/ghana-leap-1000-programme-baseline-evaluation-report",
