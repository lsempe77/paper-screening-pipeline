It provided beneficiaries with both a conditional cash and land transfer. Specifically, the program included a farm development grant (a type of cash transfer) and supported the acquisition of farmland (a productive asset) for agricultural purposes. There is no indication in the available sources that this program followed a 'graduation' model as defined in social protection literature (multi-component program with sequenced interventions designed for ultra-poor households to achieve sustainable livelihoods and exit from extreme poverty, such as the BRAC graduation approach). Rather, CBRLDP focused on asset transfer (land) and limited farm development grants, lacking the holistic suite of sequenced supports typical of graduation programs. The program did not have a structured multi-component design nor an explicit graduation objective, instead centering on land redistribution and initial support. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0301-603X2015000100010, https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/napparties/Malawi/Shared%20Documents/Kuzigulila%20Malo.PDF, https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/153621468279346913/pdf/755560PPAR0P1100Box377378B00PUBLIC0.pdf",
