  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Family Hope Program (PKH)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Family Hope Program (PKH) is officially described as a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program launched in 2007, targeting the poorest families in Indonesia to reduce poverty and improve access to health, education, and social welfare services[2][5][7]. It is not a 'graduation program' in the technical sense used by BRAC or similar models, which integrate sequenced cash, assets, and livelihood coaching to facilitate permanent poverty exit. PKH does have a process of 'graduating' families that are no longer eligible due to improved economic status, but this graduation is simply exit from the cash transfer and is not paired with productive asset transfers or bundled livelihood support[1][2][3][6]. Multiple sources, including recent World Bank evaluations, confirm that PKH provides regular cash transfers to beneficiaries[2][5][7]. While the Indonesian government has mentioned complementing PKH with various empowerment and upskilling programs for some families post-graduation, these are not part of the PKH itself and are neither systematic nor core to the program[3][4]. Very few PKH graduates reported access to economic empowerment or capital support programs[1]. There is no evidence that PKH systematically provides productive assets to beneficiaries. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099600112222138712/pdf/P1605900c895a70fc08b1f0d201c77430b5.pdf, https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/034c5441-2542-5b2c-909b-62d451ed5649, https://en.antaranews.com/news/388641/indonesia-aims-to-graduate-300000-families-from-aid-program-by-2026",
