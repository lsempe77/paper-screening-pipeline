Its core strategy is to organize poor rural women (and later, people with disabilities and ultra-poor groups) into self-help groups (SHGs), focusing on institution-building, capacity enhancement, social empowerment, access to microfinance, and livelihood promotion. The main financial support model of IKP is micro-credit provision through SHGs as revolving funds or linkages with banks for loans, not direct unconditional or conditional cash transfers. While some microfinance and loan components may help households acquire assets or invest in livelihoods, there is no clear evidence from authoritative sources that IKP provides direct, productive asset grants as featured in graduation programs (such as the BRAC model). IKP also lacks the explicit time-bound, sequenced multi-pillar graduation approach (e.g., asset transfer, coaching, cash stipends, and health/nutrition components) defining global graduation pilots. Instead, IKP stresses long-term institution-building, social capital, and group-based microfinance. Although the program delivers skill training, microloans, and enables self-help group-based activities, authoritative sources do not classify it as a 'graduation program' nor confirm routine provision of cash stipends or productive asset grants to ultra-poor households. Available documents, including World Bank and program analyses, consistently frame IKP as a SHG-based empowerment and rural poverty reduction program, not a graduation or cash/asset-transfer scheme. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.icrw.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velugu-SERP-Model-Documentation.pdf, https://www.landesa.org/wp-content/uploads/Women-Transforming-Indian-Agriculture-MKSP-Case-Stories-Landesa.pdf, https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/65495/746659885-MIT.pdf;sequence=2",
