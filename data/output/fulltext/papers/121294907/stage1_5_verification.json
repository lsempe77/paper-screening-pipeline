  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'CGIAR Climate-Smart Villages (CSVs) Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The CGIAR Climate-Smart Villages (CSVs) Program in Kenya focuses on participatory research and the promotion of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technologies and practices. The program involves activities such as testing drought-tolerant crop varieties, improving small ruminant production, establishing agroforestry nurseries, and integrating livestock into farming systems to build resilience and improve food security. It also supports the formation of self-help groups and provides climate advisory services. There is strong evidence that the program provides productive assets—including seeds, small livestock, and seedlings—but there is no mention of direct cash transfers or stipends. The program is not structured as a 'graduation' model targeting the ultra-poor with sequenced interventions (such as those modeled after BRAC or Trickle Up), but instead focuses on community-wide capacity-building and resilience, mainly targeting smallholders for adaptation to climate stress rather than graduation from extreme poverty. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://ccafs.cgiar.org/research/projects/scaling-climate-smart-village-models-east-africa, https://ccafs.cgiar.org/regions/east-africa/kenya, https://ccafs.cgiar.org/climate-smart-villages",
