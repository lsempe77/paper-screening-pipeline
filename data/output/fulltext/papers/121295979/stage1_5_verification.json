  "assessment": "NO",
  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Burundi DDR (Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration) Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Burundi DDR Program is focused on reintegrating ex-combatants into society after conflict, aiming at peacebuilding rather than poverty graduation or ultra-poor livelihood improvement. The DDR model is distinct from multi-component graduation/ultra-poor anti-poverty programs like BRAC or Terintambwe, which offer sequenced economic interventions such as cash transfers and productive assets to households. There is robust evidence for the Terintambwe graduation program in Burundi ([1], [2], [4], [6]), but there is no evidence in the search results that the DDR program follows such a graduation model or contains explicit cash or productive asset components akin to anti-poverty graduation programs. Evidence for the Burundi DDR program primarily relates to community reintegration and peacebuilding, not direct poverty graduation interventions. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/articles/report/Implementing_Coaching_and_Support_in_Graduation_Programmes_a_case_study_of_the_Terintambwe_programme_in_Burundi/26432365, https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/concerns-graduation-model-program-burundi-final-evaluation-report, https://www.ids.ac.uk/projects/burundi-graduation-programme-evaluation/",
