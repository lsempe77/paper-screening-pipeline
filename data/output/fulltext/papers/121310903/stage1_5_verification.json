While SILC groups may increase access to financial resources for vulnerable populations, it is not a graduation program as defined by the multi-component approach (consumption support/cash transfer, asset transfer, coaching, and skills training) used in 'Graduation' models associated with BRAC or J-PAL[1][3][5][8]. SILC does not provide direct cash transfers or stipends to participants, nor does it distribute productive assets; instead, members save their own money and mutually provide loans, which must be repaid, for consumption or investment purposes[4][9]. SILC may complement or be linked to graduation programs, but by itself, it is not a multi-component graduation program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.findevgateway.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/mfg-en-paper-savings-and-internal-lending-communities-silc-voices-from-africa-oct-2010.pdf, https://alnap.hacdn.io/media/documents/briefing-paper-silc-northern-ghana.pdf",
