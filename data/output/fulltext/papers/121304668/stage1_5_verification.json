  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) Technology Adoption Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) Technology Adoption Program in Bangladesh refers to broad government and donor-supported initiatives to promote the use of improved seed varieties among farmers, with the goal of increasing agricultural productivity and rural incomes. Review of the literature available shows this is primarily a technological diffusion and training program: it provides technical guidance, extension support, and in some cases inputs like seeds and fertilizer, but there is no evidence that the program contains a cash transfer or stipend component for beneficiaries[2][1]. There is also no indication it follows the graduation approach: graduation programs are characterized by multi-component interventions (e.g., combining cash, assets, training, and livelihood support targeting the ultra-poor for a defined period with exit strategies), whereas the HYV adoption initiatives are focused on technology transfer and training, not comprehensive poverty graduation. The program may sometimes provide free seeds to demonstration farmers or small input packages, but the provision of large productive assets to lift people out of poverty, as in graduation models, is not mentioned[1][2]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/impact-agricultural-training-program-technology-use-bangladesh, http://crsps.net/wp-content/downloads/IPM/Inventoried%208.7/12-2007-12-255.pdf, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aepp.70001",
