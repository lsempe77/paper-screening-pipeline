  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Subsidized Management Consulting Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Subsidized Management Consulting Program in Mexico refers specifically to initiatives that provide subsidized managerial consulting to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in order to boost productivity and hiring. According to the referenced evaluation, the intervention targets entrepreneurs and SMEs, not ultra-poor or extremely poor households. It is focused on business skills training and subsidized consulting, not on multi-component poverty alleviation. There is no evidence that this program provides direct cash transfers to participants or productive asset transfers (such as livestock or tools common in graduation programs). It is not classified as a 'graduation program' as defined by sources such as the CGAP-Ford Foundation Graduation Program or the BRAC Ultra Poor Graduation model, which are targeted at the ultra-poor, include cash stipends, asset transfers, and intensive coaching. The consulting program is a private sector development intervention, not a social protection or poverty graduation approach. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/boosting-firms-productivity-mexico-consulting-services",
