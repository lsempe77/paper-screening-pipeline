  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Di Bao (minimum livelihood guarantee system)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Dibao (Minimum Livelihood Guarantee) in China is a national means-tested social assistance program that provides unconditional cash transfers to households whose income falls below a locally determined threshold. Multiple sources confirm it is a cash transfer program: 'The Minimum Livelihood Guarantee Scheme is a national means-tested programme to provide cash transfers to the poor based on a locally set minimum income level'[2] and 'an unconditional cash transfer program known as the Rural Dibao'[7]. There is no evidence it provides productive assets or the comprehensive, sequenced multi-component support typical of graduation or ultra-poor interventions. It is not structured as a graduation program (no asset transfer, coaching, or time-bound approach), and its sole regular component is cash support. Eligibility assessment considers household assets, but the program does not distribute productive assets; instead, it only uses assets as an eligibility filter[3]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S1793930513000366, https://basicincome.org/news/2016/05/chinas-minimum-income-guarantee-youve-never-heard-of/, https://fsi.stanford.edu/publication/rural-minimum-living-standard-guarantee-rural-dibao-program-boosts-childrens-education",
