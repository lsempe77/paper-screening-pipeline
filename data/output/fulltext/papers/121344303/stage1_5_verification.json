Internet search found graduation programs in Rwanda: Perplexity search result: Rwanda has adopted a multi-component 'graduation approach' to social protection, formalized in the National Strategy for Sustainable Graduation and supported by BRAC, World Bank, and others[1][2][3][6][9]. The Vision Umurenge Program (VUP) is Rwanda’s flagship poverty program, designed to facilitate sustainable graduation from poverty, combining cash transfers (direct support for households without labor, and public works cash-for-work)[5][3] and provision of productive assets (e.g., One Cow per Family/Girinka, which delivers livestock as household productive assets)[3][2]. The national strategy's pillars require both income support (cash) and productive asset transfers for graduation. Complementary interventions, such as skills training and access to financial services, are also included[1][3][7]. These components are explicitly referenced as core to sustainable graduation in official policy documents[2][3]. Direct Financial Support is a cash component, while Girinka is an asset component. These programs are coordinated nationally under the Social Protection Strategy and graduation framework, with technical support from partners such as BRAC[1][2][9]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://ulearn-uganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Rwanda_Strategy-for-Sustainable.pdf, https://www.minaloc.gov.rw/index.php?t=f&f=57400&token=ebdc71608f1687253826e20e38990beebefe5c85, https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/a1e81e17109a11d8c895988f83cb6e3d-0140022025/related/Rwandas-Multisectoral-Approach-to-Graduation-Final.pdf",
