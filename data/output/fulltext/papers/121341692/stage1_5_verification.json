  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions '1000+ Days Programme' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: There is extensive documentation of graduation programs in India, notably the Targeting the Hard Core Poor (THP) and similar approaches by Bandhan Konnagar, Trickle Up, and World Vision. These programs deliver multifaceted support including productive asset transfers, cash support, and training targeting the extreme poor. However, the '1000+ Days Programme' in India is not referenced in any of the graduation model evaluations or impact assessments found in authoritative graduation program sources (J-PAL, IPA, Bandhan, Trickle Up, Ford Foundation). The sources closest to the phrase '1000 days' (e.g., [9]) refer to nutrition and health coverage for newborns and pregnant women, focusing on stunting reduction and maternal/child health, which is not a graduation/multi-component ultra-poor program as described in the query. There is no definitive evidence that the '1000+ Days Programme' is a graduation program or that it includes cash or asset transfers as core components, nor is it mentioned in sources that profile comprehensive poverty graduation strategies in India. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/impact-multi-faceted-livelihoods-program-low-income-households-india, https://www.fordfoundation.org/learning/library/program-evaluations/graduation-approach-case-study-india/, https://poverty-action.org/graduating-ultra-poor-india",
