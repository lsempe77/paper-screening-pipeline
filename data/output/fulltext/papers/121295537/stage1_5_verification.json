  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'China's focused poverty reduction policy' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: China's Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) programme represents a multi-dimensional poverty reduction effort combining income support, education, health, relocation, and employment. While it is not a 'graduation program' in the mold of the classic BRAC or IPA-designed Graduation Approach (which requires a sequenced set of components—time-bound cash, asset transfer, training, and savings facilitation for the ultra-poor[4]), TPA shares some overlapping elements but is broader in scale and scope. Direct cash support is provided, for example through relocation subsidies, income supplements for rural residents, and subsidies linked to poverty alleviation jobs and training (e.g., 200 yuan for participation in training; graduated cash incentives for wage thresholds)[3]. Productive assets are also provided, notably through industrial poverty alleviation projects, resettlement assistance (including livestock and new housing), startup subsidies for entrepreneurial activities, and targeted support for rural industries[1][3]. The approach is not explicitly structured as a time-bound 'graduation' pathway with defined sequencing, graduation thresholds, or monitoring as in rigorous graduation models, so it is best classified as a non-graduation, large-scale multi-component program with both cash and asset elements. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://thetricontinental.org/studies-1-socialist-construction/, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/05/Xie_Presentation-Lunyu-XIE1.pdf",
