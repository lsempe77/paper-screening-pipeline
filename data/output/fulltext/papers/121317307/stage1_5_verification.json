  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'ADB-funded pilot project for poverty reduction' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Search results describe the ADB's general graduation approach and its pilots in Asia, which commonly include both cash transfers and productive asset components[1][2][3][5][8]. However, there is no direct evidence of an official ADB-funded pilot graduation program explicitly focused on poverty reduction in the People's Republic of China. Available sources mention China's poverty reduction pilot projects in other countries, village-based interventions, and some World Bank and ADB projects linked to poverty, but none detail a graduation or cash/asset-based intervention in China itself[4][7][10]. Recent ADB graduation pilots are documented in Mongolia, Philippines, India, and Pakistan, not in China[1][2][3][6][8]. Without direct references, the presence and design of such a program in China cannot be confidently verified. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: LOW | Sources: https://www.adb.org/what-we-do/themes/social-development/overview/graduation-approach, https://www.adb.org/what-we-do/topics/social-development/overview, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZhAeqXr1NQ",
