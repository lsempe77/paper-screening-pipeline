  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI) in Bangladesh was a pilot program implemented by the World Food Programme in partnership with IFPRI, focused on determining the most effective transfer modalities for the ultra-poor. TMRI provided poor rural households, specifically mothers of young children, with either cash or food transfers, with or without a nutrition behavior change communication (BCC) component. The program was designed as a randomized controlled trial and ran from 2012–2014. All relevance sources confirm that TMRI distributed monthly cash or food transfers, but none mention any component involving the provision of productive assets (such as livestock or business equipment). Furthermore, while BCC and training were a feature, there is no evidence that TMRI included the sequenced 'graduation package' of assets, training, and consumption support that defines a true graduation program. Graduation programs, as pioneered by BRAC, involve transfer of productive assets and intensive coaching to enable sustainable livelihoods, whereas TMRI was a safety net intervention focused on consumption smoothing, food security, and nutrition behaviors. Government social protection and World Food Programme documentation clearly distinguish TMRI from graduation programs and state its emphasis on cash/food transfers with BCC rather than asset transfers or livelihood transformation. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.ifpri.org/project/transfer-modality-research-initiative-tmri/, https://voxdev.org/topic/health/how-programme-design-and-local-context-shape-lasting-effects-cash-and-food-transfers, https://bangladesh.ifpri.info/transfer-modality-research-initiative-tmri/",
