  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Vietnam Social Security System (Pensions and Social Allowances)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Vietnam Social Security System (including pensions and social allowances) is primarily a social insurance and social assistance program, providing regular cash benefits such as pensions, unemployment insurance, family allowances, and various social assistance payments (e.g., orphan benefit, single parent benefit, disability benefit). The available sources confirm regular monetary transfers to eligible participants, both under contributory (insurance) and non-contributory (assistance) modalities[1][3][4][5]. There is no evidence in any official description, World Bank report, ILO country profile, or legal summary that this program provides productive assets (such as livestock, equipment, or grants for microenterprise), nor does it follow the graduation approach (a multi-component program aiming at ultra-poor households combining cash, assets, training, coaching, and a time-bound exit strategy) seen in programs like BRAC or those promoted by J-PAL or IPA[2][5]. Therefore, it is not a graduation program and does not include an assets component. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/progdesc/ssptw/2018-2019/asia/vietnam.html, https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/457311600401962011/pdf/A-Vision-for-the-2030-Social-Protection-System-in-Vietnam.pdf, https://www.russinvecchi.com.vn/publication/social-insurance-in-vietnam/",
