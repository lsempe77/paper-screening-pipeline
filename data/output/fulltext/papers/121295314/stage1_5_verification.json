Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia is directly linked with efforts to graduate households from extreme poverty by providing a multi-component package. PSNP is cited as the foundation for graduation pilots in Ethiopia, combining regular cash (and/or food) transfers with complementary interventions such as livelihood diversification, savings groups, and asset-building support. The CGAP-Ford Graduation Program adaptation in Ethiopia relied on the PSNP as its base platform and added productive asset transfers, savings, and coaching to achieve graduation effects[1][2][4]. PSNP's core activities include delivering cash and/or food transfers to millions of rural Ethiopians[3], and evidence shows asset accumulation among participants due to complementary programs building on PSNP support[2][8]. Multiple sources confirm that PSNP involves direct cash transfers and has been a platform for adding productive asset interventions as part of layered graduation programs. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://www.ids.ac.uk/projects/ethiopia-productive-safety-net-programme/",
