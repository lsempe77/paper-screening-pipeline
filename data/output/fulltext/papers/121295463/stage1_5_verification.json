  "assessment": "NO",
  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Agriculture Rehabilitation Program (ARP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Extensive review of authoritative sources, including BRAC, J-PAL, CGAP, academic literature, and international development agencies, shows the main graduation or ultra-poor programs in Bangladesh are widely known as the 'BRAC Ultra-Poor Graduation Program,' 'BRAC Graduation Approach,' or similar. There is no evidence of a formal program titled 'Agriculture Rehabilitation Program (ARP)' in Bangladesh that fits the definition of a graduation or multi-component poverty program. The search results discuss only the BRAC-led or evaluated graduation programs, which systematically provide both cash (consumption support) and productive asset transfers as core components, but 'ARP' is not mentioned at all. There is also no evidence of an 'ARP' being a recognized or major anti-poverty program either in academic, policy, or implementation documents from Bangladesh. Without documentation or authoritative references, the graduation/cash/assets components of 'ARP' cannot be confirmed or inferred. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/impact-one-transfer-assets-and-skills-occupational-choices-low-income-women-bangladesh, https://bracupgi.org/news-updates/social-protection/graduating-poverty-unpacked/, https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/linked-documents/57225-001-sd-02.pdf",
