  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Sinapi Aba Trust (SAT)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Sinapi Aba Trust (SAT) is primarily a microfinance and microcredit institution in Ghana. The program provides banking services, loans, credit, savings, and business capacity building primarily to women and youth. According to official sources and graduation news, Sinapi Aba’s most documented interventions are training programs (mentorship for entrepreneurs, youth apprenticeship) and interest-free loans or vocational support[1][2][4]. These are generally aimed at existing clients or youth, with the primary benefit being business loans (credit) rather than unconditional cash transfers or direct livelihood asset transfers. There is no evidence from official sites or news that Sinapi Aba Trust runs a 'graduation' (BRAC-style) ultra-poor poverty alleviation program, which is a multi-component intervention featuring sequenced asset transfers, cash stipends, training, and mentoring. Likewise, the available information describes loan/credit provision (sometimes interest-free, but always repayable and not cash transfers), as well as training, but does not mention direct transfer of productive assets (such as livestock or goods) typical of graduation programs. No major study (World Bank, J-PAL, IPA) identifies SAT as a flagship graduation program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://sinapiaba.com/155-women-graduate-sinapi-aba-mentorship-programme, https://www.sinapiaba.org/one-hundred-and-fifty-youth-graduate-under-sinapi-abas-youth-apprenticeship-program-accra, https://sinapiaba.com/celebrating-success-sinapi-abas-fourth-mentorship-program-graduation",
