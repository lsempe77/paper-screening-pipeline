The grants are used to purchase land and agricultural implements, but there is no evidence that LRAD offers direct cash transfers or stipends to beneficiaries. Instead, financial support is given in the form of non-repayable grants strictly earmarked for asset acquisition (primarily land and sometimes agricultural implements)[1][3]. The program's objective is not structured as a graduation or multi-component poverty alleviation program in the sense of the 'graduation approach' (such as those modeled by BRAC or J-PAL), which typically involve sequenced interventions (consumption support, training, asset transfers, etc.) combined with cash transfers and a deliberate 'exit' from extreme poverty. LRAD is best classified as an asset transfer/land reform program rather than a comprehensive graduation or anti-poverty package[1][3][2]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.nda.gov.za/phocadownloadpap/Policy_Documents/Land%20Redistribution%20for%20Agricultural%20Development.pdf, https://researchspace.ukzn.ac.za/bitstreams/7916f6af-247e-4b42-ac94-f393d1d4cf6e/download, https://www.dlrrd.gov.za/phocadownloadpap/General_Publications/Land%20Redistribuition%20for%20Agricultural%20Development.pdf",
