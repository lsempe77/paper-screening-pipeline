Multiple impact evaluations (see, for example, J-PAL and IDB) consistently describe the program as a classic CCT model providing short-term cash stipends to incentivize school attendance and health check-ups, leading to increased human capital investments[1][3][5][7][8]. There is no evidence from these sources that the RPS program includes a direct component for productive assets or explicitly provides assets such as livestock, equipment, or business grants. The program does not meet the graduation model criteria, which require a coordinated package of cash, assets, and intensive training or mentoring with a focus on transitioning the ultra-poor to sustainable livelihoods. The literature and reviews consistently describe the program as a transfer-only intervention for human capital formation, and not part of a 'graduation' set of interventions, nor multi-component in the graduation sense[3][5][8]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://publications.iadb.org/en/more-schooling-and-more-learning-effects-three-year-conditional-cash-transfer-program-nicaragua, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/long-term-effects-conditional-cash-transfer-program-nicaragua, https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/034c5441-2542-5b2c-909b-62d451ed5649",
