  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Land reform and Green Revolution programs' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Land reform programs in the Philippines, notably the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), are primarily designed to redistribute agricultural land (a productive asset) to landless farmers and farm workers, with the intention of alleviating poverty through asset provision[1][2][3][4]. The Green Revolution initiatives focused on providing agricultural technologies, new seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation infrastructure to improve productivity, which also constitutes the provision of productive assets[6][7][8]. These programs are not designed as graduation or ultra-poor interventions in the mold of BRAC's multi-component graduation programs: they do not systematically combine staged cash transfers, asset transfers, training, and coaching targeted at the ultra-poor. CARP included some support services (like credit and infrastructure) in addition to land redistribution, but sustained cash transfer or stipend components for beneficiaries are not evidenced in the literature[1][3][5]. While financial assistance via credit and marketing were sometimes mentioned, this is distinct from unconditional or regular cash transfers. Thus, the program is not a graduation or multi-component poverty program as defined by BRAC, J-PAL, or IPA; it does provide productive assets (land), but evidence for structured cash transfer components is lacking. The official names referenced in sources are Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) for land reform and Green Revolution for agricultural technology programs. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.fao.org/4/j0415t/j0415t08.htm, https://www.ibon.org/land-reform-is-key-to-rural-development-green-action-ph/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform_in_the_Philippines",
