Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources explicitly confirm the Concern Worldwide Graduation Programme in Rwanda is a graduation or multi-component anti-poverty program targeting extremely poor households. Peer-reviewed and organizational reports consistently describe a sequenced, integrated approach including cash transfers, coaching/mentoring, livelihood/business skills training, and productive asset transfers. Detailed documentation of core package components shows monthly cash transfers to meet basic needs (minimum 12 months, averaging RwF 18,000/month) and asset transfers intended to enable sustainable livelihoods—these sometimes delivered as cash to be invested in livestock, land, or microenterprise assets. Both the classic and newer 'Green Graduation' variants delivered these elements. There is extensive evidence this is a recognized graduation model (linked to the BRAC model) with both cash and productive asset support. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://concernusa.org/whitepapers/understanding-post-programme-graduation-trajectories-in-rwanda-2020.pdf, https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/221d28e2-8084-454d-b75f-f9f18e5b51b3, https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/unleashing-capacities-vulnerable-households-concern-worldwides-graduation",
