  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Maziko trial' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Maziko trial, officially known as the MAZIKO - Malawi Integrated Maternal and Child Grant Project, is a multi-component program that integrates maternal and child cash transfers with social and behavior change (SBC) interventions. The program provides cash transfers to households with pregnant women and children under 5 years of age in Ntcheu and Balaka districts, Malawi. The cash transfer amounts are approximately 17 USD and 43 USD per month in different arms of the trial. The program also includes nutrition-sensitive SBC activities and capacity strengthening interventions but does not mention the provision of productive assets such as livestock, tools, or training for livelihoods. While the program is multi-component and includes cash and SBC, there is no evidence that it follows the graduation approach (which typically includes assets, training, and support for livelihoods) as defined by programs like BRAC's Graduation Approach. Therefore, it is unclear if it is a graduation program, but it does provide cash transfers and does not provide productive assets. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38218938/, https://massp.ifpri.info/2023/10/06/maziko-malawi-integrated-maternal-and-child-grant-project/, https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/document/maziko-malawi-integrated-maternal-and-child-grant-project",
