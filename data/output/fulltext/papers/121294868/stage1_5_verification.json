Its primary modality is providing cash support, with the transfer amount often calculated as the difference between household income and the local threshold. There is no evidence in credible sources that the program provides productive assets or livelihood support typical of 'graduation' programs, nor is it described as having integrated multi-component pathways out of poverty (such as skills training, asset transfers, or linkages to employment). Therefore, it is not a graduation program and does not involve provision of productive assets, but it is confirmed to provide cash transfers. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://fsi.stanford.edu/publication/rural-minimum-living-standard-guarantee-rural-dibao-program-boosts-childrens-education, https://hummedia.manchester.ac.uk/institutes/gdi/publications/workingpapers/GDI/GDI_WP1822_Wang.pdf, http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/464451468154454071/Any-guarantees-Chinas-rural-minimum-living-standard-guarantee-program",
