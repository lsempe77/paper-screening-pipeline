  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Nepal Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Nepal Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) is a multi-component poverty reduction program established to support the rural poor, focusing on capacity building, community infrastructure, and income generation through a community-driven model. The program emphasizes providing grants for small-scale infrastructure and funding for sustainable income generation, including productive assets and revolving credit for income-generating activities. There is no explicit evidence that the PAF implements the 'graduation approach' as defined by BRAC/J-PAL (multi-component program combining asset transfer, mentoring, and time-bound cash support to transition individuals out of ultra-poverty). Regarding cash transfers, while PAF supports credit and income generation activities, explicit unconditional or regular cash stipends/transfers as a major component are not clearly documented in main evaluations or project descriptions. Multiple sources confirm asset and productive input support, such as revolving funds and grants for income-generating activities. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://giwmscdntwo.gov.np/media/app/public/56/posts/1684843052_68.pdf, https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/650211563297105965/pdf/Nepal-Second-Poverty-Alleviation-Fund-Project.pdf, https://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/nep137763.pdf",
