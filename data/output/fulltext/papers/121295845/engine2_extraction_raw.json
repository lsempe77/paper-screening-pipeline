One such pathway is through improvements in overall household wellbeing, which might then improve child diet. Another is through improvements in hygiene and sanitation, which could plausibly reduce child illness. Other mediating factors could include women's status (if the livelihoods interventions were to change women's activities such that their status or bargaining power improved, which could in turn affect investments in children).
