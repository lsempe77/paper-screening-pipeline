  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'DFID Programme to Accelerate Improved Nutrition for the Extreme Poor'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The DFID Programme to Accelerate Improved Nutrition for the Extreme Poor in Bangladesh was not a standalone project but operated by integrating direct nutrition interventions into three major livelihood programs: Chars Livelihoods Programme (CLP), Economic Empowerment of the Poorest (EEP/Shiree), and Urban Partnership for Poverty Reduction (UPPR)[1][2][3]. All these underlying programs are widely identified as multi-component graduation programs targeting the extreme poor, providing a combination of cash transfers, productive assets, training, and other support aimed at sustainable livelihoods and poverty reduction. The impact evaluations specifically note that the DFID program layered nutrition support onto existing graduation/livelihood interventions, which, in the case of the CLP and EEP, are well-documented to include both cash transfers and productive asset schemes (such as cows, goats, or other productive packages)[1][2][3]. The cash and assets components are integral to the graduation model and the livelihoods programs in Bangladesh, which the DFID initiative worked through. While individual citations from the evaluation focus on nutrition impacts, the program’s structure as an intervention piggybacked on graduation/livelihood programs provides high confidence that both cash and productive asset transfers were part of its operational model. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/articles/online_resource/Impact_evaluation_of_the_DFID_Programme_to_accelerate_improved_nutrition_for_the_extreme_poor_in_Bangladesh_Final_Report_Accelerate-Improved-Nutrition-Extreme-Poor-Bangladesh/26477338, https://mqsunplus.path.org/resources/impact-evaluation-of-the-dfid-programme-to-accelerate-improved-nutrition-for-the-extreme-poor-in-bangladesh-phase-ii/, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evaluation-of-the-dfid-programme-to-accelerate-improved-nutrition-for-the-extreme-poor-in-bangladesh",
