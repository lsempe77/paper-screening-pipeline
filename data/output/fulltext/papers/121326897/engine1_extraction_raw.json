Does not evaluate any cash transfer or productive asset program\n2. Instead focuses on studying how natural forest resources contribute to climate adaptation\n3. Contains no intervention components matching the required criteria\n\nThe study is about forest dependency and natural resource use, not about programmatic interventions."
