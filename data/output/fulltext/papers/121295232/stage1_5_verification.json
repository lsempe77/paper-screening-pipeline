Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) in Ethiopia is verified as a graduation or multi-component poverty program. Multiple sources clearly describe its use of a 'graduation approach,' sequencing cash transfers/consumption support, asset transfers, training, and coaching to help ultra-poor households achieve sustainable livelihoods and escape poverty[1][2][3][4][5]. PSNP provides regular cash (or food) transfers as consumption support to targeted rural poor households[2][3], and several evaluations and implementation documents confirm it offers productive asset transfers (either in subsidized form or directly)[2][3]. The involvement of organizations like BRAC, IFPRI, and CARE, and explicit references to 'graduation' and asset/cash components, further substantiate this. Graduating means households no longer need transfers and can meet their food needs sustainably, typically after receiving cash, asset transfers, and other support[3][4][5][8]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://www.care.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spir_learning_brief-sustainability_of_psnp_household_graduation-final_0.pdf",
