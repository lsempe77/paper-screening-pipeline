  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Land titling and registration programs' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Land titling and registration programs are interventions designed to provide legal recognition of land ownership and clarify land boundaries, primarily through formal documentation and registration of land titles. These programs do not fit the graduation model as defined by BRAC, J-PAL, IPA, or the World Bank, which typically include multi-component interventions such as cash transfers, productive asset transfers, skills training, and regular coaching aimed at 'graduating' ultra-poor households into sustainable livelihoods[2][3][5][8]. There is no evidence in evaluation literature, graduation program documentation, or impact evaluations that standard land titling or registration initiatives systematically provide direct cash transfers or supply productive assets. Instead, these programs focus on legal empowerment, land tenure security, and sometimes economic inclusion indirectly by making it easier for beneficiaries to leverage their land as collateral. While some poverty-focused multi-component programs may include land titling as one component within a larger graduation package, the land titling and registration programs themselves are not designed as graduation programs and do not routinely deliver cash assistance or productive assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.cgap.org/sites/default/files/CGAP-Focus-Note-Reaching-the-Poorest-Lessons-from-the-Graduation-Model-Mar-2011.pdf, https://poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/2023-07/IPA%20DOLE%20Graduation%20Final%20Report_April%202022.pdf, https://www.ppaf.org.pk/doc/programmes/Poverty%20Graduation%20Booklet_2018.pdf",
