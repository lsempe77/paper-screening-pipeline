Increased tenure security reduces the likelihood and fear of losing the value of investments made in the land, which means that overall investment in the land is stimulated.

Secure formal land rights can provide a real and secure source of collateral, which increases the availability of credit to obtain funds for investment in or even purchase of land. 3.
