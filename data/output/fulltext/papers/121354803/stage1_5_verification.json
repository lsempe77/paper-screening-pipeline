  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Village Pay Phones (VPP) Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Village Pay Phones (VPP) Program in Bangladesh, led by Grameen Bank and Grameen Telecom, provides access to telecommunication by leasing mobile phones to poor, primarily female, microfinance members[1][4][7][8]. Ownership of the phone allows these women to generate income by selling phone services locally, empowering them economically and socially[1][7][8]. There is no credible evidence that the VPP program offers direct cash transfers or stipends as a core feature—rather, the asset (the mobile phone) itself is the intervention[1][4][8]. The program does not follow the multi-component 'graduation' model (as promoted by BRAC), which typically combines asset transfers, cash stipends, training, and social support; instead, VPP focuses exclusively on productive asset provision (the phone) as a microenterprise tool. It is therefore not classified as a graduation or multi-component poverty program and does not have a cash component, but does provide a productive asset. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/84729/1/zef_dp08.pdf, https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/abe2a3ef-0ce7-55a4-a25a-fd0b0e7b5e34, https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.282.5388.409",
