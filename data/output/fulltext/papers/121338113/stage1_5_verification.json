These sources describe the maquila sector as a driver of poverty reduction through direct wage employment and creation of job opportunities. However, there is no evidence that this is a formal poverty graduation program in the sense used by BRAC, IPA, or J-PAL, which typically involve multi-component interventions including cash transfers, productive asset provision, and intensive coaching to help the ultra-poor transition out of poverty. Instead, the maquila sector contributes to poverty reduction via private sector job creation, not via structured cash transfers, stipends, or assets. There are graduation-style programs in Honduras (such as those evaluated by IPA and J-PAL), but they are distinct from the maquila sector interventions.[1][2][3][4][5][6] | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1312272, https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstreams/ba62c69c-9a66-5144-8a60-225d32cbdbcb/download, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13600818.2012.732562",
