  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: LEAP is Ghana's flagship social protection program, launched in 2008 to provide cash grants and health insurance to extremely poor and vulnerable households[1][3][4][5][6]. Its primary components are unconditional or lightly conditional cash transfers and free enrollment in national health insurance. Official program documentation and multiple evaluations consistently confirm the cash transfer element[1][4][6]. There is no evidence that LEAP provides productive assets or implements the 'graduation' model (e.g., asset transfers, intensive livelihood training, or bundled multi-component interventions like those evaluated as 'graduation approaches' in other contexts) within its design or operation[1][3][5][6]. Graduation-style interventions with asset transfers have been rigorously tested in Ghana under distinct pilot projects and evaluations, but these are separate from LEAP and often explicitly labeled as the 'Graduation from Ultra Poverty (GUP)' program[2]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/ghana/, https://leap.mogcsp.gov.gh/1143-2/, https://ssph-journal.org/journals/international-journal-of-public-health/articles/10.3389/ijph.2023.1605336/full",
