  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) in China, launched officially in 2014-2015, is a multi-faceted poverty reduction program that aims to end absolute poverty through highly targeted measures for identified poor households and counties[1][2][4]. While TPA involves direct financial (cash) assistance to poor households, such as monetary subsidies and income supplements, and provides incentives for participating in training or employment (e.g., wage subsidies/rewards)[3], it does not fit the international definition of a 'graduation program.' 'Graduation programs' (like the BRAC model) are time-bound, sequenced interventions for the ultra-poor with an explicit pathway—typically comprising cash transfers, asset transfers, training, savings, and mentoring—leading to sustainable livelihoods. TPA, instead, mobilizes a broader array of interventions, including cash support, asset transfers (e.g., relocation to better housing, productive resources, support for local businesses or farming), and public employment. Multiple verified sources attest to the existence of both cash and asset components: direct subsidies and incentive payments for work/training are cited, as are the provision of new homes and productivity-related assets[3][1]. No source describes TPA as fitting the 'graduation program' archetype as defined by BRAC, J-PAL, or the World Bank. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://www.china-ces.org/Files/3058abstract/202412170201434113.pdf, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/05/Xie_Presentation-Lunyu-XIE1.pdf",
