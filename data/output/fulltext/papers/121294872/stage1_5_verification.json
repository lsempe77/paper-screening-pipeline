These schemes do provide cash payments to providers of ecosystem services (in the case of PLDL, 550 yuan per mu per year), making a clear 'cash component.' However, their main objective is environmental conservation, not long-term poverty graduation or reaching the 'ultra poor' with consumption support plus assets, nor do they provide productive assets such as livestock or equipment. While such programs can affect livelihoods and income, they do not match the minimum standards of multi-component graduation or ultra-poor programs as defined by BRAC, J-PAL, or IPA, nor do they involve randomized impact evaluations focused on extreme poverty graduation. No evidence was found that these schemes systematically provide productive assets; rather, they incentivize behavioral change via incremental or opportunity-cost cash payments[2][4]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://spj.science.org/doi/10.1080/20964129.2018.1434318, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3799363/, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21622671.2025.2515059",
