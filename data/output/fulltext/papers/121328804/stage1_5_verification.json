  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Commune Sangkat Fund (CSF)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Commune/Sangkat Fund (CSF), established in Cambodia in 2001, is an intergovernmental fiscal transfer system intended to finance both administrative and development activities at the subnational level[8][9]. The available official sources describe CSF primarily as a mechanism for transferring budgetary resources to local governments to support public service delivery, local infrastructure, and administrative costs. There is no evidence from any authoritative source that the CSF is designed as a graduation or multi-component poverty program, nor that it provides direct cash transfers to households or distributes productive assets like livestock or vocational kits. Some sources describe the budgeting and transfer mechanism (funds from central to local administrations)[4][8][9], but none mention direct ultra-poor targeting, cash stipends, or asset distribution typical of graduation approaches (as seen in other Cambodian programs like the UNDP Graduation-Based Social Protection project[2][3][7], which is a separate pilot targeting ultra-poor households with cash and asset interventions). | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/cam212739.pdf, https://opendevelopmentcambodia.net/social-accountability/sub-national-administration-budgets/, https://www.social-protection.org/gimi/Media.action;jsessionid=OWXGLktz3PI3Aab9oKp-VCli2Z-aIsi-bJnN5kDToeCmAcn0r95p!-2073956956?id=12611",
