Evidence from three separate data sets shows the extent of poverty reduction in each of three phases of the CSF program. An implication of this finding is that for decentralization to succeed in reducing poverty, decisions over how to spend the program's resources must be based on local information. This local representation of preferences enables communes to choose projects for their long-run returns. For example, infrastructure projects were chosen over social spending, even though the benefits of social spending are more immediate.\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"study_characteristics\": {\n    \"outcomes_measured\": [\"poverty reduction\", \"income/earnings\", \"consumption/expenditure\"],\n    \"outcomes_evidence_citation\": \"Households having access to CS funds experienced, on average, an 8.7% reduction in their likelihood of being in poverty (first column).
