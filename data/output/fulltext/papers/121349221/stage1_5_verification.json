  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) is Nigeria’s broad economic and social reform strategy launched in 2004. It is a national policy framework designed to address development, economic growth, and poverty reduction, but it is not a targeted poverty graduation program in the mold of BRAC-style or World Bank-supported ultra-poor graduation interventions. While NEEDS sets the general direction for programs in areas such as employment, infrastructure, and social safety nets, it does NOT directly administer cash transfers or distribute productive assets. Verified social protection programs delivering cash and livelihoods assets to poor Nigerians—such as the National Cash Transfer Programme (NCTP)/Household Uplifting Programme—are separate and operate under the National Social Investment Program (NSIP), not under NEEDS. There is no credible evidence that NEEDS itself distributes cash or assets directly, or that it follows the graduation model. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://nassp.gov.ng/what-we-do/national-cash-transfer-programme, https://www.aneej.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FAQ-on-the-National-Cash-Transfer-Programme.pdf, https://odi.cdn.ngo/media/documents/7578.pdf",
