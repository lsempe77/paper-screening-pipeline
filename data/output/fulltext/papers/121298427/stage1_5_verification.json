  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'DOLE Integrated Livelihood Program (DILP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The DOLE Integrated Livelihood Program (DILP) in the Philippines was the foundation for a Graduation Approach pilot conducted in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank, BRAC, and Innovations for Poverty Action. The pilot is documented as a graduation program targeting ultra-poor households and incorporates all key graduation elements, including asset transfer, intensive coaching, financial literacy, and skills training[1][2][3][6]. However, the cash component in the Graduation pilot came from the separate Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program managed by DSWD, not DOLE DILP itself[1]. DILP provides a one-time transfer of productive assets and associated training as its main livelihood support (not cash stipends)[1][2][3]. Multiple sources explicitly state asset transfers are the core of DILP intervention, and impact evaluations refer to DOLE’s role as the provision of livelihood assets, not direct cash[1][2][6]. The official program name—as per sources and government documents—is 'DOLE Integrated Livelihood Program (DILP)'[2][6]. Confidence is high since cited sources include official reports, government websites, and evaluations from respected organizations. | Graduation: YES, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://bracupgi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DOLE-Philippines-Graduation-Country-Brief-Final.pdf, https://poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/2023-07/IPA%20DOLE%20Graduation%20Final%20Report_April%202022.pdf, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative-project/adapting-graduation-approach-scale-government-livelihood-programs-philippines",
