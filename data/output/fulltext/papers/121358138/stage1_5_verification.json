It is not a classic 'graduation program' as defined by BRAC or similar organizations—where ultra-poor households receive sequenced support including productive asset grants, training, and continued stipends for a fixed period, with a defined graduation threshold. Instead, China's approach blends targeted social assistance (cash support and subsidies), investments in education and health, productive asset transfers, skills training, relocation, and local employment generation. Evidence of cash components includes financial assistance, direct subsidies to registered poor households, and cash rewards for job performance. The assets component is present through relocation support (new housing), agricultural input/livestock provision, and job placement services. However, the program's design is much broader and centrally administered than classic graduation models, targeting a wide definition of 'poor' households, not just the ultra-poor, and integrating social services at scale. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://thetricontinental.org/studies-1-socialist-construction/, https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents/ameizhang_0.pdf",
