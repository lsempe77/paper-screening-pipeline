The program provides land transfers to landless farmers along with additional grants for infrastructure improvements. While it's not a traditional graduation program, it does include both productive asset transfers (Component B) and cash support in the form of infrastructure grants (Component A). The study uses quasi-experimental methods with propensity score matching to evaluate impacts on investments, assets, and income over a 2006-2010 period."
