The main component is access to land (a productive asset) via loans or subsidized credit, rather than outright cash transfers or stipends. The program aims to enable eligible individuals to purchase land and invest in their agricultural production, but does not include a direct cash grant or regular stipend for consumption. While the program delivers a key asset (land) and facilitates investment in productive resources, there is no evidence that it provides multi-component interventions characteristic of 'graduation' or ultra-poor programs (such as BRAC's model), which typically combine cash support, asset transfer, training, and intensive livelihood support. The program is targeted at increasing productive capacity and improving livelihoods, but does not meet 'graduation' program criteria as defined by international agencies and academic sources. Multiple official and third-party sources confirm the asset-focused, credit-based nature of the intervention. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.gov.br/mda/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/acoes-e-programas/programas-projetos-acoes-obras-e-atividades/programa-nacional-de-credito-fundiario, https://www.anater.org/programa-credito-fundiario/, https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/869521468224087526/pdf/916590BRI0Box30ion0402001000Public0.pdf",
