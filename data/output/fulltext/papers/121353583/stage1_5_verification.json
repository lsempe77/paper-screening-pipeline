  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Hogares Comunitarios Program (HCP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Hogares Comunitarios Programme (HCP) in Guatemala was established primarily as a government-subsidized community childcare initiative to support low-income working parents, especially women, by providing low-cost, quality child care within the community[1][4]. The primary aim is to enable parents' labor force participation and support child nutrition and welfare. Evaluations and descriptions of the program highlight provision of day care, meals (breakfast, lunch, snacks), security, and hygiene for young children, but there is no evidence it is a graduation or multi-component poverty program like the BRAC/IPA models, which combine cash transfers, assets, and livelihoods support targeting the ultra-poor for a defined 'graduation' from poverty. There is no evidence of direct cash transfers or stipends to families, nor is there a component for providing productive assets. The focus is on affordable early childhood care, not household economic empowerment through cash or asset transfer. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.fao.org/4/y1931m/y1931m05.pdf, https://cgspace.cgiar.org/items/10776e91-6856-42ab-b2da-d44cfe8bc6e2, https://infantstudies.org/voices-from-the-field-community-based-solutions-for-young-children-in-guatemala/",
