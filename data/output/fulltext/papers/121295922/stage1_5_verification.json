  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Small and Micro Community Enterprises (SMCEs) programme' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Available sources refer to the Small and Micro Community Enterprises (SMCEs) programme in Thailand as an initiative focused on supporting small local businesses through capacity building, training, and accounting support. The program aims to enhance management competencies and sustainability of community enterprises, but there is no direct evidence it is structured as a graduation or multi-component poverty program (such as BRAC’s Graduation Approach) targeting the ultra-poor with a clear pathway out of poverty involving multi-step support. There is no evidence that SMCEs provides direct cash transfers or stipends to participants. The main interventions described include business training and technical support. There is also no indication in the sources that the program distributes productive assets to beneficiaries. The role of the SMCEs program is to assist existing and aspiring micro-entrepreneurs in improving their business practices and sustainability rather than delivering multi-faceted poverty alleviation packages targeting the poorest households. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://mis.agri.cmu.ac.th/download/publication/3250_file.doc, http://www.sustainability.chula.ac.th/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CU_SDG_Report2022_23_EBook.pdf, https://rgsa.openaccesspublications.org/rgsa/article/view/6505",
