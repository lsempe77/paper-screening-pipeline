  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Millennium Village Project (MVP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Millennium Villages Project (MVP) in Kenya was a large-scale, multi-sector rural development intervention aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals in extremely poor African communities. MVP focused on integrated delivery of services and inputs across agriculture, health, education, and infrastructure rather than operating as a 'graduation program' in the BRAC sense: it did not feature sequenced, targeted components such as asset transfers plus training and mentoring designed explicitly for the ultra-poor to 'graduate' from extreme poverty. Instead, MVP interventions included improved seeds and fertilizer, access to health care and education, infrastructure improvements, and microcredit/cooperative training.[5][4] While business development services such as microcredit and cooperative training were components, there is no evidence MVP systematically provided direct cash transfers or livelihood startup stipends as in classic graduation programs, nor did it target the ultra-poor with these tools. The program did supply productive assets (notably high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and farm inputs) to boost agricultural productivity and income, often distributed broadly rather than individualized for ultra-poor households.[4][5] Therefore, MVP does not fit the definition of a graduation program, lacks a cash transfer component, but does provide productive assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Villages_Project, https://www.millenniumpromise.org/millenniumvillages, https://people.climate.columbia.edu/projects/view/1682",
