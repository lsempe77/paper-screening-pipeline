  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Guangcai Programme' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Guangcai Program in China, launched in 1994, is an industrial poverty alleviation initiative led primarily by private entrepreneurs. Its core approach centers on development-oriented poverty reduction, involving private enterprise investment in industrial projects, agricultural modernization, ecological conservation, resettlement, healthcare, infrastructure, and employment creation in poor areas[1][2][4][5][6][7][9]. The program's main activities include investing in productive assets—such as factories, agricultural projects, and infrastructure—offering training, creating jobs, and facilitating market access. There is no evidence in official program descriptions or third-party reports that it provides direct cash transfers or stipends to individuals. Its multi-component structure is focused on productive investments, rather than the graduation program model typical of BRAC or J-PAL initiatives, which combine cash support, training, and asset transfers for ultra-poor households. Instead, Guangcai is a private sector-led, development platform prioritizing enterprise investment, technology, and opportunity creation, without a direct household-level asset transfer or cash stipend component. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://upr-info.org/sites/default/files/documents/2013-08/cspgpchnuprs42009anxpovertyalleviation.pdf, http://en.newhopegroup.com/zeren.html, http://www.cspgp.org.cn/ywb/CSPGP/",
