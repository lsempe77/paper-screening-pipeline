It primarily provides market access, logistics infrastructure, digital skills, and entrepreneurship development, but there is no robust evidence that it directly provides unconditional cash transfers or productive physical assets to poor households as core program components. Instead, it focuses on enabling environments for rural e-commerce, such as training, ICT platforms, and logistics, to facilitate income growth via market opportunities[1][2][4]. Some local variations may offer microcredit or training, but the core intervention is not asset transfer or cash stipend. Graduation programs, as defined in the literature (e.g., BRAC's model), usually involve multi-component interventions for ultra-poor households including both asset transfers and cash support, which is not the design here. The available evidence from multiple impact evaluations, World Bank reports, and academic studies indicates positive income effects, but primarily through enabling entrepreneurship rather than direct resource transfer. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/115883/1/Zhang,%20Millan,%20Money%20&%20Guo_E-commerce%20Development,%20Poverty%20Reduction%20and%20Income%20Growth%20in%20Rural%20China.pdf, https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/e-commerce-and-mobile-money-poverty-reduction-china-lessons-african-countries.pdf, https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/552791574361533437/pdf/E-commerce-Development-Experience-from-China.pdf",
