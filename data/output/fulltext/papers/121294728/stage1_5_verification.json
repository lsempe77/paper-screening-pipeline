Multiple sources consistently describe HUP as a conditional or unconditional cash transfer program, providing regular cash transfers (NGN 5,000/month or bi-monthly) to beneficiary households to alleviate poverty and promote investment in health and education[2][3][4][6]. The program comprises a base cash transfer, top-ups for specific conditions (such as sending children to school or accessing health care), and a 'livelihood support' component[2][3]. However, the detailed nature of the 'livelihood support' is not well described in terms of providing productive physical assets (e.g., livestock, tools, or inventory) versus general support or training. The references do not explicitly describe HUP as a graduation or multi-component program in the sense of the BRAC ultra poor graduation model, which combines assets, intensive training, and mentoring over a fixed period[7]. Instead, HUP resembles other large-scale cash transfer programs for the poor, focusing on short-term alleviation and some promotion of social inclusion and welfare. While 'livelihood support' is mentioned, there is insufficient direct evidence that physical assets or substantial enterprise inputs are provided under HUP. No direct references affiliate HUP with the 'graduation' paradigm as explicitly as documented for the Kaduna State Ultra Poor Graduation Programme[1], which is a sub-national and different initiative. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0325594, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12176151/, https://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/AEC/2020/presentations/effects_of_household_uplifting_programme_on_welfare_status_of_beneficiaries_in_nigeria_.pdf",
