Internet search found graduation programs in Niger: Perplexity search result: The Niger National Cash Transfer Program is a government-led unconditional cash transfer scheme targeting poor households. Recent evidence and multiple high-quality sources indicate that the program has incorporated a multi-component, 'graduation-style' trial. This graduation pilot, rigorously evaluated by the World Bank and research partners, offered: (1) core cash transfers (~$16/month for 2 years); (2) group savings, coaching, and entrepreneurship training (all arms); and in some arms, (3) productive capital grants (a lump-sum cash grant of ~$127 intended as productive asset/capital transfer). The existence of this multi-faceted enhancement and the explicit mention of its similarity to the graduation approach (with direct reference to the 'capital package') confirm its status as a poverty graduation program with both core cash and asset components. This is supported by randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed journals and reports by J-PAL/IPA and the World Bank. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04647-8, https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/impactevaluations/yes-we-can-unbundling-poverty-graduation-programs-cost-effective-impact, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evidence-effect/graduation-approach",
