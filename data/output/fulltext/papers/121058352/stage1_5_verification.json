Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The BRAC Ultra-Poor Graduation Programme in Bangladesh is recognized globally as the pioneering \"graduation\" model for ultra-poverty. Multiple authoritative sources, including BRAC itself, UN (Lamia Rashid's paper), J-PAL, IPA, and program evaluations, describe the program as a multi-component approach designed to help extremely poor households 'graduate' out of ultra-poverty through a sequenced package of interventions. Key components are: (1) provision of cash transfers or consumption stipends to support immediate needs; (2) transfer of productive assets (e.g., livestock, goods for trade) to kick-start reliable livelihoods; (3) training, coaching, and access to savings. These features are consistently referenced in impact evaluations, program handbooks, and peer-reviewed studies. The cash/consumption stipend and productive asset transfer, specifically, are foundational and universally cited elements of the core BRAC graduation model in Bangladesh. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://bigd.bracu.ac.bd/study/evaluation-of-the-sustainable-ultra-poor-graduation-upg-model/, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/04/Lamia-Rashid-BRAC-Ultrapoor-Graduation-Paper-for-UN-Expert-Group-Meeting-May-2017-25Apr17.pdf, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/targeting-ultra-poor-improve-livelihoods",
