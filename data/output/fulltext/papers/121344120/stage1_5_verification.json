  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Local Efforts for Empowerment and Development (LEAD) Project'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The 'Socio-Economic Empowerment for Graduation out of Poverty' program in Sri Lanka is a government-led initiative under the Department of Samurdhi Development. Its explicit aim is to support beneficiaries (poor and extreme poor households) to 'graduate out of poverty' via a coordinated package including life skills development, livelihoods, and regular coaching. The program components are clearly listed as including 'transfer' (which typically refers to cash or in-kind transfers), 'business capital' (a productive asset component), and 'coaching' among others. Digitally delivered components also include 'transfer' and 'business capital.' The program is multi-component and specifically targets impoverished groups to help them build sustainable livelihoods, which aligns closely with the global graduation approach (e.g., BRAC model). There is no explicit mention of the program name 'Local Efforts for Empowerment and Development (LEAD) Project' in authoritative sources, but the description matches the graduation approach in Sri Lanka under Samurdhi. No source links the precise 'LEAD' acronym to this program, so the official name found is used. Both the cash (transfer) and asset (business capital) components are confirmed in the source. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/node/1655",
