Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia is explicitly described as a graduation or multi-component poverty program, designed to enable chronically food-insecure households to meet basic needs, build assets, and graduate from food insecurity. Multiple sources reveal that PSNP's graduation model involves a sequenced combination of regular cash (or food) transfers to meet immediate consumption needs and grants for livelihood and productive asset acquisition (including subsidized asset or cash transfers to kick-start economic activities)[3][2][1]. The program is recognized for its layered approach, integrating consumption support with livelihood training, savings facilitation, and productive (often in-kind or cash) asset support as part of its core design[2][3][1]. The official program name is 'Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP)'; references to 'Conditional Cash Transfer Component' are not standard nomenclature but accurately describe a key aspect of the program. These findings consistently confirm that the PSNP is a graduation-oriented program with both cash and productive asset components. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://www.care.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spir_learning_brief-sustainability_of_psnp_household_graduation-final_0.pdf",
