  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Millennium Villages Project (MVP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Millennium Villages Project (MVP) in Ghana is an integrated rural development initiative aiming to address extreme poverty through interventions in agriculture, health, education, infrastructure, and business development.[3][4][5][6] There is no evidence that the MVP follows the 'graduation approach' as defined by BRAC (which involves targeted ultra-poor identification, sequenced asset and cash transfers, skills training, and coaching as a multi-component ultra-poor graduation program); rather, MVP focuses on community-wide development, not targeted ultra-poor graduation[3][8]. While MVP includes business development with micro-credit and improved agricultural inputs, there is no evidence in official or evaluation documents of routine cash transfer (stipends) being a core intervention, nor of household-level productive asset transfers in the style of graduation programs. Programs explicitly named as 'Graduation Approach' in Ghana are different, such as those evaluated by J-PAL/IPA, and are not part of MVP[1][2]. Thus, MVP is not a graduation program and does not prominently feature household-level cash or productive asset transfers. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Villages_Project, https://www.millenniumpromise.org/millenniumvillages, https://www.itad.com/project/ghana-dfid-impact-evaluation-of-mvp-sada-northern-ghana-millennium-village/",
