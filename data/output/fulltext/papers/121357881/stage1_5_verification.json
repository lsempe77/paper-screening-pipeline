  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'JigisemeJiri (Tree of Hope) and Common Framework on Seasonal Social Safety Nets (CCFS)'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Jigisemejiri (Tree of Hope) in Mali is officially referenced as a national social safety net program targeting poor and food-insecure households, providing social assistance since 2013[2][5]. Multiple sources explicitly confirm it is a multi-component program: it provides unconditional cash transfers to vulnerable households (over 70,000 households have accessed cash transfers)[1][10], and impact evaluations show these transfers reduced food insecurity and led to increased household livestock investments and savings[1], indicating a productive asset component. Additional evidence from official social protection inventories lists Jigisemejiri under programs with asset and input transfers and social support services, consistent with graduation program models[4][7]. Several sources mention graduation after participation (12 months), and program documentation links it to household graduation criteria and productive inclusion[4][7]. Some documents also connect Jigisemejiri to international frameworks for seasonal safety nets (CCFS), but the official name consistently used is 'Jigisemejiri (Tree of Hope).' No sources explicitly dispute these features. The sources are up-to-date, official, and include program evaluations and government/World Bank publications. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/400261569204060059/pdf/Mali-Performance-and-Learning-Review-of-the-Country-Partnership-Framework-for-the-Period-of-FY16-FY19.pdf, https://archives.au.int/bitstream/handle/123456789/6664/UNDP_RBA_Soc_Assis-Report.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y, https://ipcid.org/sites/default/files/pub/en/Social_Protection_in_Africa.pdf",
