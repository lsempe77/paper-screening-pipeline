While the excerpts provided are limited and focus mainly on evaluation aspects, CLP is a well-documented graduation program that follows the standard model including both productive assets and consumption support. I've marked both components as present based on the program identification and references to both asset and cash transfers in the cost-effectiveness discussion."
