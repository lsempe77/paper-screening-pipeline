While their ultimate goal is to improve livelihoods and potentially reduce poverty, their core activities are focused on facilitating collaboration, learning, and innovation rather than directly providing cash transfers or productive assets. There is no evidence in the literature or implementation documents that suggests these platforms deliver cash transfers (stipends) or directly distribute productive assets to participants—a key feature of 'graduation' or ultra-poor-targeted livelihood programs. Instead, the emphasis is on participatory research, value chain strengthening, and building institutional arrangements. Graduation programs, like those implemented by BRAC or evaluated by J-PAL, typically contain time-bound transfers of cash and/or assets with support services; no such mechanisms are described for the SSA CP IPs. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/items/107d542c-af8d-46e2-a49d-64fc81e88266, https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/219475849.pdf, https://library.faraafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Spreading_the_gains_of_agr_innovations.pdf",
