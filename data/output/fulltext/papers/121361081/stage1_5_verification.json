There is clear evidence from multiple sources, including the official LEAP site and program evaluations, that the main intervention is cash grants provided regularly to targeted households[1][2][3][5][6][7]. The goal of LEAP is primarily to alleviate short-term poverty, improve access to health and education, and encourage behavioral change toward productive activities. However, there is no evidence in official or evaluation reports that LEAP disburses productive assets (such as livestock, tools, or direct livelihood inputs) to beneficiaries, nor is it described as a comprehensive 'graduation' program of the BRAC type combining sequenced supports like skills training, asset transfer, and coaching. While LEAP may, in some cases, offer referrals or promote long-term welfare, it lacks the multi-component structure that characterizes graduation programs. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/ghana/, https://www.ssph-journal.org/journals/international-journal-of-public-health/articles/10.3389/ijph.2023.1605336/full, http://akatsinorth.gov.gh/reassessment-of-the-leap-program/",
