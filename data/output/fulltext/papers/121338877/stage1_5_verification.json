  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'ECOWAP/CAADP (Common Agricultural Policy of ECOWAS)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The ECOWAP/CAADP is the regional agricultural policy and investment strategy for the ECOWAS region, focusing on broad goals such as food security, rural development, increased agricultural productivity, poverty and hunger reduction, and policy coordination among member states. There is no direct evidence that ECOWAP/CAADP is a 'graduation program' as defined by the literature — i.e., a targeted social protection scheme for ultra-poor households combining cash, asset transfers, training, and long-term exit strategies[2][5][8]. Instead, ECOWAP/CAADP is an overarching policy framework implemented through national and regional investment plans, including various agricultural development projects, but it does not directly provide unconditional or regular cash transfers/stipends to households[2][5][6]. Specific projects associated with ECOWAP/CAADP, such as the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Programme (WAAPP), provide agricultural technologies and sometimes assets, but these are oriented towards productivity and usually not targeted household-level asset transfers for the ultra-poor as seen in graduation programs[4]. There is insufficient direct evidence that the core policy has an asset transfer component comparable to graduation program models. It is a multi-component agricultural development policy, not a targeted graduation or ultra-poor social protection program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://ecowap.ecowas.int/about-ecowap, https://nepad.org/where-we-work/region/113, https://www.araa.org/en/strategic-areas-ecowap",
