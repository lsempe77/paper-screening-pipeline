  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Integrated graduation-style program'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Extensive evidence supports that 'integrated graduation-style programs' in Uganda represent multi-component initiatives targeting extremely poor or vulnerable households. These programs universally include core graduation elements: regular cash transfers (consumption support), productive asset transfers (either in-kind or as lump-sum cash for investment), and extensive skills training, mentorship, and coaching. For instance, the SMILES project (AVSI Foundation) provided both monthly cash transfers for consumption and lump-sum business capital to households, explicitly identified as a graduation program[1]. IPA research describes 'an integrated graduation-style program involving cash transfers as well as extensive training and mentorship,' confirming both cash and assets are included[2]. The CARE WAYREP project demonstrates similar features: multi-purpose cash transfers, business and financial training, and access to start-up capital for microenterprise, all under a graduation framework[3]. The BOMA and ACDI/VOCA models, as referenced, confirm asset transfers may be provided either in-kind or as unrestricted cash to ensure productive investment, and are considered essential to the graduation approach[4]. These programs are well-documented in impact literature (IPA, J-PAL, World Bank) as the 'graduation' model, combining regular cash, productive asset transfers, and training/coaching for sustainable livelihoods. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.avsi.org/en/news-and-press/news/cash-transfers-in-a-graduation-programme-what-we-did-and-what-we-learnt, https://www.bracinternational.org/research-library/cash-plus-poverty-impacts-of-alternative-transfer-based-approaches/, https://care.at/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-MPCT-Learning-Brief-full-report.pdf",
