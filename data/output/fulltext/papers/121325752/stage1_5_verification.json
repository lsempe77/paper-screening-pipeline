Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The ASHA (Hope) Project in Bangladesh is verified as an integrated intervention targeting both mental health (specifically depression) and economic strengthening for people in extreme poverty. Peer-reviewed literature describes the ASHA intervention as a blend of depression treatment and economic strengthening activities, specifically designed for ultra-poor women in Bangladesh. Detailed protocols for ASHA report that economic strengthening activities are modeled after the BRAC Ultra Poor Graduation program, including productive asset transfers and cash stipends. The official protocol paper (Joshi et al., 2024) describes two components: (1) a cash stipend and (2) a productive asset grant, both delivered in sequence. These elements confirm that the program is a graduation model (multi-component, sequenced with time-limited support) and includes both cash and assets. Clinical trial listings and peer-reviewed articles confirm the intervention name and primary details. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://shareenjoshi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ASHAProtocolPaper.pdf, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06295250, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7796166/",
