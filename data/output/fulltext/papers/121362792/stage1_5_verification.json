Evidence from multiple sources describes this as a strategy integrating tourism development with rural revitalization—most often by creating employment, establishing community tourism enterprises, and promoting local industry (such as agriculture). Rural residents benefit through job creation, income opportunities, and sometimes support to establish homestays or small businesses, which amounts to providing productive (income-generating) assets or business opportunities[1][2][3]. There is no strong evidence that Chinese tourism poverty alleviation programs are specifically 'graduation programs'—as defined by interventions like BRAC or IPA, i.e., targeted ultra-poor, time-bound, multi-component, with sequenced assets and intensive coaching. Rather, these are broad rural development efforts relying on market integration, infrastructure, and community business support, not focused, sequenced asset transfer plus coaching and cash. On cash transfers: there is some anecdotal evidence that villagers directly employed in tourism-related enterprises receive salaries[3], but this is regular wage income, not unconditional or conditional cash transfers as in social protection or graduation models. Regarding productive assets: multiple sources confirm that villagers sometimes receive support for starting businesses, running homestays, or accessing productive infrastructure[1][2][3]. Official program names vary, but the verified generic name is 'Tourism-Based Poverty Alleviation' in China. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.wta-web.org/eng/news/news_066, https://scholarworks.umass.edu/bitstreams/d579d5f4-ed55-44f0-88ea-a5855aec2f4b/download, https://en.people.cn/n3/2022/1111/c90000-10170214.html",
