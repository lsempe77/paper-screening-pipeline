While the program included subsidized fertilizers and improved cassava varieties, there is no clear evidence of direct cash transfers or consumption support. The study used regression analysis to evaluate impacts on cassava production and food security outcomes.\n\nKey points:\n1. Component A (Cash) is marked as false as there's no mention of cash transfers, stipends, or consumption support\n2. Component B (Assets) is marked as true based on clear evidence of fertilizer subsidies and improved cassava varieties\n3. The study used quantitative methods (regression analysis) without qualitative components\n4. The program ran from 2001-2007 and was implemented nationally with focus on specific regions"
