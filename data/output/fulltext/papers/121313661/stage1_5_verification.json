  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Presidential Cassava Initiative (PCI)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Presidential Cassava Initiative (PCI), officially known as the Presidential Initiative on Cassava (PIC), was established in Nigeria to boost cassava production and processing, primarily through mandates for flour inclusion and infrastructure investments[2][3][4][8]. The initiative focused on upgrading cassava processing facilities and providing modern equipment to farmers—indicating a productive assets component[3][8]. It was not structured as a 'graduation' or multi-component poverty program targeting the ultra poor, nor did it use the graduation model (e.g., BRAC or World Bank-supported integrated livelihoods)[2][8]. There is mention of short-term loans, e-wallets, or potential subsidy distribution in discussions of sector support, but direct cash transfers or stipends for ultra-poor beneficiaries are not explicitly described in sources[2][3]. The program was predominantly agricultural-industrial, not a targeted social protection or livelihood graduation scheme. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://globalanticorruptionblog.com/2024/12/20/breadwinner-for-whom-lessons-from-nigerias-cassava-bread-initiative/, https://punchng.com/reps-seek-fg-cbn-support-for-cassava-farmers/, https://taat-africa.org/news/sustainable-cassava-seed-system-is-crucial-to-fighting-hunger-in-africa-chief-olusegun-obasanjo/",
