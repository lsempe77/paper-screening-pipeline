  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI) in Bangladesh was a randomized controlled trial implemented by the World Food Programme (WFP) and IFPRI to test the impact of different transfer modalities for ultra-poor rural households. TMRI provided monthly cash or food transfers to mothers of young children, sometimes coupled with behavior change communication (BCC)[2][4][6]. There is no evidence TMRI included the transfer of productive assets or skills training, which are necessary components for a poverty 'graduation' program. 'Graduation' programs (such as the BRAC Ultra Poor Graduation program) typically include cash or in-kind transfers, asset transfers, training, and coaching over an extended period[3][1][5]. TMRI focused on improving food security and nutrition rather than facilitating a sustained transition out of poverty. Thus, TMRI is not a graduation program.However, TMRI did provide cash transfers (monthly cash) but not productive assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.ifpri.org/project/transfer-modality-research-initiative-tmri/, https://voxdev.org/topic/health/how-programme-design-and-local-context-shape-lasting-effects-cash-and-food-transfers, https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/social-protection/global-issues-and-debates-2/graduation-and-cash-plus/",
