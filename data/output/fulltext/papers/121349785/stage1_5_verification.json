Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Income Generation for Vulnerable Group Development (IGVGD) program in Bangladesh is recognized as an early model that influenced BRAC's later Graduation programs. It combines components typical of graduation and multi-component poverty programs: sequences safety nets (including food support and/or cash), livelihood training, and assets transfer. Multiple sources note IGVGD provides both cash/consumption support and productive assets to extremely poor women, in addition to skills training and financial inclusion services, to help participants move out of ultra-poverty. These features are core to the 'Graduation approach' which is documented as beginning with IGVGD and later formalized in BRAC’s Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP) and UPG programs. Evidence from World Bank and academic sources explicitly links IGVGD to the Graduation model, confirming its cash and assets components. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09614524.2024.2317836, https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/818891468331772094/pdf/633360BRI0Reac00Box0361513B0PUBLIC0.pdf, https://socialprotection.gov.bd/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lessons-from-the-Graduation-Model.pdf",
