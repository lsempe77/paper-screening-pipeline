Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The BRAC Ultra-Poor Graduation Programme, originally known as Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP), was designed and first implemented by BRAC in Bangladesh. It is internationally recognized as a pioneering 'graduation' program. The Graduation Approach is a multi-component model delivering a holistic set of interventions over a set time (usually around 24 months), with the explicit goal of enabling the ultra-poor to achieve sustainable livelihoods and 'graduate' from extreme poverty. Key components, described in academic studies and by BRAC itself, include: (1) transfer of a PRODUCTIVE ASSET to start a microenterprise (such as livestock or equipment), (2) CASH provision in the form of a 'consumption stipend' or regular cash transfers during the program's early phases to stabilize food security, (3) skills training, (4) savings facilitation, and (5) intensive coaching and mentoring. Major evaluations confirm this package—a productive asset plus a cash stipend—and this is clearly specified in multiple sources (J-PAL, UN paper, primary BRAC documents). The program is widely cited as the archetype for 'graduation' interventions globally. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.bracusa.org/solutions/development/poverty/ultra-poor-graduation/, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/targeting-ultra-poor-improve-livelihoods, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/04/Lamia-Rashid-BRAC-Ultrapoor-Graduation-Paper-for-UN-Expert-Group-Meeting-May-2017-25Apr17.pdf",
