  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Ethiopian Livelihood Investment Grant (LIG) pilot program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Ethiopian Livelihood Investment Grant (LIG) pilot program, cited in official World Bank and IPE Global documents, refers to a component under Ethiopia’s Protection of Basic Services (PBS) program, specifically as a pilot 'Local Investment Grant.' This grant was a specific-purpose transfer from the federal government to selected woredas (districts) for capital investments in five basic services sectors: education, health, water, agriculture, and rural roads[2][3][4]. The main aim was to strengthen basic service delivery by financing infrastructure and improvements within local government-managed sectors. There is no evidence that LIG provided direct cash transfers or stipends to households or individuals, nor did it provide targeted productive assets to beneficiaries. Rather, the grants funded public goods and capital works at the local government level. Furthermore, the program is not described as a graduation or multi-component poverty alleviation program akin to those providing time-bound, sequenced support for ultra-poor households with both cash and asset transfers (as seen in programs modeled after BRAC or similar). | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/505941555007140478/pdf/Ethiopia-Enhancing-Shared-Prosperity-Through-Equitable-Services-ESPES-Program-for-Results.pdf, https://www.ipeglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ethiopia-Brochure.pdf, https://www.inspectionpanel.org/sites/default/files/ip/PanelCases/82-Eligibility%20Report%20(English).pdf",
