Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources confirm that KSEIP is structured as a multi-component program with explicit graduation, or economic inclusion, components. An official process review and documentation from OPM and the World Bank detail that KSEIP includes (a) ongoing cash transfer support (through NSNP, Inua Jamii, and programs like NICHE), and (b) a pilot Economic Inclusion Programme (EIP) which is described as testing a 'poverty graduation approach' designed to complement regular cash transfers with support for human capital and livelihoods of the extreme poor[3][4][5][7]. Graduation-style pilots supported by BOMA/Village Enterprise specifically include the provision of productive assets, training, and mentorship on top of cash transfers[7]. The recent World Bank and government documents also describe scaling up 'cash-plus' programs (implying the additional delivery of livelihoods support or productive assets alongside regular cash assistance)[4][6]. KSEIP2 further mainstreams and scales these approaches nationwide[2][4][6]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.opml.co.uk/sites/default/files/2024-06/HSNP-phase-3-mentoring-process-review-v1-1.pdf, https://www.peiglobal.org/node/1475, https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/07/17/twelve-million-kenyans-to-benefit-from-a-new-social-protection-project-aimed-at-strengthening-human-capital-and-economic",
