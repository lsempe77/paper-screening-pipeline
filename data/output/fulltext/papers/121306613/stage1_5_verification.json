  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'BRAC Graduation Model'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: All available sources directly identify the BRAC Graduation Model as the pioneering, multi-component graduation program designed to help households move out of extreme poverty through a sequenced package of interventions. Multiple sources specify cash support or consumption support (such as stipends or lump sum cash) as a core element of the model, as well as the transfer of productive assets (such as livestock or equipment). For example, BRAC explicitly defines the 'Graduation Essentials' as including a productive asset (or lump sum cash), support for basic needs (typically through cash transfers), and coaching[2]. The UN technical paper confirms that diversified assets and cash support are provided over a typical intervention period[3]. Rigorous program reviews, including J-PAL and Ford Foundation syntheses, highlight that graduation programs involve both cash support and provision of a business asset, along with complementary training and coaching[5][7]. These features are consistent across implementation in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Pakistan, Peru, and Honduras. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.wvi.org/sites/default/files/2019-07/WV-BRAC%20Ultra-Poor%20Graduation%20Handbook%20V2%20-%20July%2019.pdf, https://bracupgi.org/news-updates/economic-inclusion/introducing-the-graduation-essentials-core-components-designed-for-scale/, https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/04/Lamia-Rashid-BRAC-Ultrapoor-Graduation-Paper-for-UN-Expert-Group-Meeting-May-2017-25Apr17.pdf",
