  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Zimbabwe Land Reform Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Zimbabwe Land Reform Program, including its 'Fast Track' phase, is a redistributive land program designed to transfer agricultural land from former white commercial farmers to black Zimbabweans. Its core focus is on directly allocating land (a productive asset) to beneficiaries, often among the rural poor, to address historic inequities and alleviate poverty[1][2][3][4][5][7]. The program does not have documented features characteristic of graduation or multi-component poverty programs, such as a coordinated package of cash transfers, skills training, mentorship, and asset grants modeled after the BRAC graduation approach. There is no credible evidence from any authoritative or academic source that the program provided regular cash transfers, stipends, or bundled support as found in graduation-style programs. All cited material point to direct land transfer as the mechanism, rather than a multifaceted, staged graduation approach. Therefore, the program is not a graduation or multi-component poverty alleviation program in the sense used by BRAC, J-PAL, or others; nor does it offer cash, but it does provide productive assets (land). | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08ae4ed915d622c000985/60332_Zimbabwe_Land_Reform.pdf, https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297a/Land%20Reform%20in%20Zimbabwe.doc, https://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/morocco/proceedings/TS4/TS4_4_chitsike.pdf",
