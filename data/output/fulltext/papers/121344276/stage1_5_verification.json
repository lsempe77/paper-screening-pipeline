The program's main intervention is providing regular cash payments (e.g., 70 Kwacha per month, about $11-12) to eligible households, without conditions such as school attendance or health visits[1][2][3][5]. While one of the program's objectives is to increase household ownership of assets such as livestock, this refers to indirect effects of the cash transfer, not to the direct provision of productive assets or integrated asset transfer or training components typical of 'graduation' programs[2][3]. Impact evaluations indicate the CGP improved household food security and some asset ownership, but evidence shows these changes faded after the program ended, and the cash alone was insufficient for 'graduation' out of poverty in the graduation model sense (i.e., sustained exit from extreme poverty through a multi-component approach)[3]. There is no evidence that productive assets (such as livestock or business equipment) were directly provided by the program[2][3][4]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6711746/, https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/zambia/, https://www.3ieimpact.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/DPW1.1042_Zambia_UCT.pdf",
