  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'China national poverty reduction program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: China’s national poverty reduction efforts, officially referred to as the 'China National Poverty Alleviation Programme,' utilized a multidimensional strategy to end extreme poverty between 2015 and 2020. The program combined minimum income guarantees (cash assistance/social assistance), investments in education, housing, healthcare, and the provision of productive assets such as livestock, seeds, and equipment for income-generating activities, especially in rural and poor areas[1][4][6]. However, the program is not described in academic or official documents as a 'graduation program' in the sense used by organizations like BRAC, J-PAL, or the World Bank Ultra-Poor Graduation model which entails time-bound, integrated asset/cash/skills interventions followed by an explicit 'graduation' from extreme poverty. While China's approach is multidimensional and comprehensive, leading to large-scale sustainable poverty exit, it is not directly modeled on or explicitly characterized as a 'graduation program'. The program includes significant cash transfer/social assistance components as well as livelihood (productive asset) transfer and support for families to escape poverty. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://thetricontinental.org/studies-1-socialist-construction/, https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/bdadc16a4f5c1c88a839c0f905cde802-0070012022/original/Poverty-Synthesis-Report-final.pdf, https://en.qstheory.cn/2021-04/30/c_617642.htm",
