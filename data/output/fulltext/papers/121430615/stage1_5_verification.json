Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Cash and In-Kind Grant Experiment in Ghana is documented as an implementation of the 'Graduation approach'—a multi-component program that systematically targets the ultra-poor with the aim of moving them to sustainable livelihoods and out of extreme poverty. This program, evaluated by Innovations for Poverty Action and J-PAL, is explicitly described as a graduation model, which features six core components: productive asset transfer, consumption support, training, savings, coaching, and access to health. The published evaluation clarifies that the intervention included a one-time 'productive asset transfer' (such as livestock or agricultural inputs) and, crucially, 'consumption support,' which is provided as cash transfers. Therefore, both a cash component and a productive assets component are core verified elements. Multiple program reviews and impact evaluations refer to this project as the 'Ghana Graduation pilot' or 'Graduating the Ultra-Poor in Ghana,' and detail both cash and asset components. Evidence of being a graduation program, cash transfers, and asset grants is robust and consistent across scholarly and practitioner sources. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/graduating-ultra-poor-ghana, https://www.cgap.org/sites/default/files/CGAP-Focus-Note-Reaching-the-Poorest-Lessons-from-the-Graduation-Model-Mar-2011.pdf, https://www.theigc.org/blogs/graduation-whats-next-ultra-poor-programmes",
