    "reasoning": "While component_a_present = true and is_loan_or_credit = NO, the cash grant (150 Ghanaian cedis) appears to be for business investment rather than consumption support. This should be considered under criterion 3 as productive asset support rather than consumption/cash support."

    "assessment": "YES",
    "reasoning": "component_b_present = true, direct_provision = YES, with program providing equipment, materials, and inventories. Additionally, the cash grant is explicitly for business investment, making it a form of productive asset support."
