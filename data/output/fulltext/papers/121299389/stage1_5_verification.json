Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Ethiopian Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) is a multi-component national social protection intervention designed to improve food security and build resilience among ultra-poor rural households. It is cited as both a safety net and a graduation program: PSNP uses regular cash (and sometimes food) transfers for consumption support, preventing asset depletion, and enabling beneficiaries to stabilize their lives, a core element of the graduation approach. The latest phase of PSNP explicitly includes 'graduation' goals: households are considered graduated when they can consistently meet their food needs and manage modest shocks without program support. Additionally, PSNP (and PSNP-linked graduation pilots such as SPIR) provide productive asset transfers—such as subsidized livestock or cash grants for income-generating activities—as part of livelihood packages, alongside technical and financial training. These elements match the globally recognized graduation model (BRAC/CGAP-Ford Foundation). Multiple sources confirm all key components: cash transfers, asset transfers, and multi-dimensional support targeting the ultra-poor. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://gsdrc.org/document-library/lessons-from-ethiopia-on-a-scaled-up-national-safety-net-programme/",
