  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Millennium Villages Project (MVP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Millennium Villages Project (MVP) is a large-scale, integrated rural development project aimed at lifting communities in sub-Saharan Africa out of poverty. Its approach focuses on simultaneous investments in sectors such as agriculture, education, health, and infrastructure rather than a sequenced, time-bound intervention targeting the ultra-poor for 'graduation' as defined by the BRAC/CGAP-Ford Foundation model. No credible reports or evaluations indicate that MVP delivered direct cash transfers or one-off productive asset transfers to ultra-poor households—the hallmark features of graduation programs. Instead, the MVP provided community-wide infrastructure, agricultural inputs, education materials, and health interventions, aiming for systemic improvement rather than individual livelihood pathways seen in graduation models. MVP is frequently distinguished from 'graduation' programs like those cited by the World Bank and BRAC, which feature individual asset transfers, regular consumption stipends, intensive coaching, and targeted exit ('graduation') criteria. No published MVP documentation, academic evaluation, or credible secondary source suggests that core MVP programming included household-level cash stipends or productive asset transfers as part of a graduation model. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.millenniumpromise.org/millenniumvillages, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Villages_Project, https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2018/04/a-look-at-the-millennium-villages-project.html",
