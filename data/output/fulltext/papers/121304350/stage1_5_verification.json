  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Multiple programs: CT-OVC (Kenya), CGP (Lesotho), CGP (Zambia), LEAP (Ghana)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The CT-OVC in Kenya, CGP in Lesotho, CGP in Zambia, and LEAP in Ghana are all major national social safety net programs primarily designed as unconditional cash transfer schemes targeting extremely poor and vulnerable households, with an emphasis on child welfare, elderly, or labor-constrained populations in each country. These programs provide regular cash payments to beneficiaries to enhance consumption, nutrition, and access to social services such as education and health. They are not 'graduation' or 'multi-component' programs in the strict sense—for example, they do not systematically combine cash with substantial productive asset transfers, business training, coaching, or access to financial services, as outlined in the classic 'graduation approach' used by BRAC and others. While cash transfer programs can yield positive livelihoods spillovers, the core program design focuses on cash support, not asset provision or comprehensive livelihoods packages. No clear evidence was found of a structured productive assets component in any of these programs. Evidence for all programs comes from government, World Bank, and several evaluation sources, confirming their cash transfer nature and the lack of standard graduation components. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.childrenservices.go.ke/cash-transfer-orphans-and-vulnerable-children-ct-ovc, https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/kenya/, https://www.calpnetwork.org/publication/the-government-of-kenya-cash-transfer-for-orphaned-and-vulnerable-children-cross-sectional-comparison-of-household-and-individual-characteristics-of-those-with-and-without/",
