Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) in Ethiopia is a multi-component poverty program that includes both cash transfers and productive assets as part of its interventions. The program targets chronically food-insecure and poor households, providing them with regular cash or food transfers during the agricultural off-season. Additionally, PSNP incorporates asset-building components such as the provision of agricultural technologies (fertilizer, improved seed, pesticides, herbicides), specialized training on livestock management, and distribution of productive assets like bee hives. The program also includes graduation models, such as the Graduation Approach, which aims to help households move out of extreme poverty by combining consumption support, asset transfers, and livelihood training. Evidence from multiple sources confirms these components and the program's focus on graduation from poverty. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://www.fordfoundation.org/learning/library/research-reports/graduation-approach-case-study-ethiopia/",
