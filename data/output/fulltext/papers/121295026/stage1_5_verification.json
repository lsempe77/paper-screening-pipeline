  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Government drug and substance abuse mitigation programs' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Kenya's government drug and substance abuse mitigation programs, as described in the search results, are primarily focused on treatment, rehabilitation, prevention, public awareness, and capacity building for service providers. These programs (e.g., NACADA’s Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention (ADAP) program, rehabilitation centers in various counties) train professionals and provide free rehabilitation services to affected individuals, often culminating in 'graduation' ceremonies for those who complete treatment[2][3][5][7]. However, these 'graduation' events refer to completion of rehabilitation or training, rather than the 'graduation' model in poverty programs (which targets ultra poor households with sequenced support such as cash, assets, and livelihood coaching, leading to economic self-sufficiency as linked to BRAC or J-PAL). None of the documented government drug mitigation programs in Kenya offer explicit cash transfers or productive assets to beneficiaries. The support is psychosocial, medical, and sometimes includes training or linkage to mentorship/entrepreneurship, but not material asset transfers or regular cash stipends. There is no evidence of multi-component poverty graduation programming (stipends, asset transfer, livelihood coaching, targeting ultra-poor households) within these programs. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.jkuat.ac.ke/jkuat-staff-equipped-with-professional-skills-to-combat-substance-abuse/, https://uasingishu.go.ke/index.php/uasin-gishu-county-sets-national-pace-in-free-rehabilitation-as-12-graduate-in-moiben-rehabilitation-and-treatment-centre, https://kenyatopstories.co.ke/index.php/2023/09/08/special-graduation-ceremony-for-those-rehabilitated-from-alcohol-drug-and-substance-abuse/",
