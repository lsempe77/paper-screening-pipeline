It focused on the rapid distribution of cash grants using debit cards ('Watan Cards') to flood-affected families. Multiple authoritative sources confirm that the program provided unconditional cash transfers or grants (PKR 20,000-40,000 in phases) to beneficiaries, using bank cards for disbursement[1][2][3][5]. There is no evidence in program documentation or evaluations that productive assets—such as livestock, tools, or business capital—were provided. Graduation-type programs are characterized by a sequenced package of support, typically including asset transfers, training, coaching, and cash support with a long-term focus on sustainable livelihoods for the ultra-poor. The Watan Card/CDCP was an emergency, single-component cash relief program, not a multi-component or graduation intervention, and did not include livelihood, asset transfer, or capacity-building elements[1][2][3]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.gfdrr.org/sites/default/files/Pakistan%20Citizens%20Damage%20Compensation%20Program%20(CDCP).pdf, https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/153031468139211888/pdf/806210WP0P12680Box0379812B00PUBLIC0.pdf, https://www.rspn.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/BB-National_Report_CDCP_Final.pdf",
