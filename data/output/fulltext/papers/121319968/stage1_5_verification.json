Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia is a large-scale social protection program designed to address chronic food insecurity and build the resilience of poor households. It delivers cash and/or food transfers to millions of rural Ethiopians, most commonly through public works or direct support. In addition to these transfers, the program has been explicitly linked with 'graduation' objectives: participants are expected to achieve food security and become self-reliant, with progress towards graduation regularly monitored. Impact evaluations and policy reviews confirm that PSNP not only provides regular cash transfers but also aims to support asset accumulation and productive investments, which are core to the graduation strategy. The PSNP is commonly referenced as a multi-component poverty program, and there is significant evidence of productive asset support being provided through both regular program channels and through intensive NGO-led graduation pilots layered onto the main PSNP scheme. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.ids.ac.uk/projects/ethiopia-productive-safety-net-programme/, https://essp.ifpri.info/2025/10/13/graduating-from-ethiopias-productive-safety-net-programme-what-have-we-learned/, https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia",
