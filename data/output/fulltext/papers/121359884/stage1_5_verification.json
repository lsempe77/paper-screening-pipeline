Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) in Ethiopia is not a single-component cash transfer program, but rather a large-scale, multi-component poverty alleviation initiative. The PSNP aims to increase resilience, improve food security, and support asset accumulation among chronically food-insecure households. It provides cash or food transfers through public work requirements for able-bodied participants and unconditional direct support for labor-poor households. Multiple sources show that the PSNP focuses on building productive community and household assets through labor-intensive public works such as watershed development, infrastructure, and environmental management. There is also documented evidence of modest but significant household asset accumulation attributed to the program. Graduation—defined as households achieving food self-sufficiency and no longer needing external assistance—is a central goal, and the program has piloted and adopted a graduation approach built around the BRAC/CGAP-Ford Foundation Graduation model, including a SPIR graduation pilot layered over PSNP. Therefore: (1) PSNP is a multi-component initiative with a graduation orientation; (2) it provides cash transfers; and (3) it develops productive assets both at the community level and, through some pilots and integrated activities, at the household level. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://capacity4dev.europa.eu/projects/project_psnp_ethiopia_en",
