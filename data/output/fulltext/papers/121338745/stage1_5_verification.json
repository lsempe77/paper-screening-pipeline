These programs provide regular, unconditional cash transfers to elderly individuals who often lack contributory social security; for example, Brazil's Benefício de Prestação Continuada and South Africa's Older Persons Grant operate on this model[1][2][3][4][5][7][8]. The evidence clearly demonstrates these are not graduation or multi-component poverty reduction programs in the sense used by BRAC or J-PAL, which combine cash, assets, training, and mentoring to facilitate a sustainable exit from extreme poverty. Instead, these pensions focus solely on cash income support—they do not provide productive assets, training, or a time-bound pathway designed for 'graduation' from poverty status. Multiple independent studies and reviews confirm these programs’ primary function is to alleviate old age poverty through regular cash—no standard evidence links the delivery of productive assets or multi-component support under these schemes. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/08d8f23d-4299-568e-b9b5-706aafb53a0d/content, https://www.helpage.org/silo/files/noncontributory-pensions-and-poverty-prevention-a-comparative-study-of-brazil-and-south-africa-.pdf, https://gsdrc.org/document-library/non-contributory-pensions-and-poverty-prevention-a-comparative-study-of-brazil-and-south-africa/",
