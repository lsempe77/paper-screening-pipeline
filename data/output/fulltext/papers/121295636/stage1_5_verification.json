Search did not find relevant graduation programs in Malawi and Zambia: Perplexity search result: The Social Cash Transfer Programme (SCTP) in Malawi and Zambia is an unconditional cash transfer initiative targeted at ultra-poor and labor-constrained households. Its primary goal is poverty reduction through regular cash transfers to vulnerable households[1][2][3][6]. The SCTP has been discussed in research about graduation from poverty, and its potential to support 'graduation' is analyzed in monitoring and policy documents[1], but it is not designed as an integrated graduation or multi-component program in the BRAC/J-PAL sense. True graduation programs feature bundled interventions (cash, assets, training, mentoring), with explicit graduation criteria and asset transfers. SCTP’s documented interventions are limited to cash transfers, with no direct provision of productive assets or comprehensive livelihood components[1][2][3][6]. Similarly, discussions about households 'graduating' out of poverty via the SCTP refer to longer-term impact, not to formal asset or livelihood support. The 'Multiple Categorical Targeted Grant (MCTG)' is not explicitly described in available sources, and there’s no evidence it adds a productive assets or graduation component distinct from SCTP. All credible sources confirm regular cash is the central benefit. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Malawi-SCTP-Baseline-Report-Final-Dec-2022.pdf, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8757493/, https://www.3ieimpact.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/DPW1.1042_Zambia_UCT.pdf",
