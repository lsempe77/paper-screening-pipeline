Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN) in Tanzania is clearly structured as a multi-component poverty reduction and graduation program. Multiple sources confirm that the PSSN provides an integrated package of support to extremely poor households, including conditional cash transfers (CCTs), public works, skills training, savings facilitation, coaching, and livelihood enhancement activities, with a graduation focus to help beneficiaries achieve sustainable self-reliance[1][4][6][7][9]. The program includes cash transfers as a core feature, both unconditional and conditional, to address immediate consumption needs[3][4][5][6]. Critically, the PSSN also provides productive assets, specifically through the Livelihood Productive Grant (LPG), which offers qualifying households an asset transfer of about US$250 to help launch approved business plans, combined with skills training and support[1]. All sources directly reference these components as part of the official 'Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN)' program under the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF), confirming both the graduation approach and the presence of both cash and asset transfer mechanisms. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/311680/1/1916787916.pdf, https://povertyevidence.org/challenge-fund/tanzania-challenge-fund/enhancing-social-protection-and-poverty-reduction-through-a-conditional-cash-transfer-program-in-tanzania/, https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PSNN_Updated.pdf",
