  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'BRAC poverty alleviation programme'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The BRAC Ultra-Poor Graduation Programme, launched in Bangladesh in 2002, is internationally recognized as the pioneering 'graduation' approach to extreme poverty. Multiple authoritative sources describe it as a holistic, multi-component program that integrates productive asset transfers (commonly livestock or inventory), cash or in-kind consumption support to stabilize immediate needs, skills training, savings facilitation, and regular coaching. J-PAL, UN, and BRAC’s own documentation explicitly list both productive asset transfers and cash (or conditional stipend) components as fundamental features of the model. The program’s efficacy and multi-component design have been validated in multiple randomized controlled trials and cited as the template for global graduation program replications. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/04/Lamia-Rashid-BRAC-Ultrapoor-Graduation-Paper-for-UN-Expert-Group-Meeting-May-2017-25Apr17.pdf, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/targeting-ultra-poor-improve-livelihoods, https://www.bond.org.uk/news/2025/07/why-the-graduation-approach-could-be-the-key-to-ending-extreme-poverty/",
