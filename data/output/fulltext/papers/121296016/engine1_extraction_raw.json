While there is mention of investments and resources, I don't see clear evidence of consumption support or cash transfers, so I've marked component_a as false. The program does provide productive assets through income-generating activities (component_b = true). The study is a randomized controlled trial with clear outcome measurements in consumption, food security, education, and other areas."
