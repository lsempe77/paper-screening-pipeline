The PAF provides support through small-scale infrastructure, capacity building, and grants to community organizations primarily for income generation and local infrastructure projects. The main instrument is the provision of productive assets in the form of grants or revolving funds for income-generating activities, often including livestock, seeds, or tools[3][6]. There is no evidence in official evaluations or program documentation indicating regular cash transfers or stipends as a program component[3][5][6][8]. PAF is not termed a 'graduation program' (as the term is commonly used for multi-component interventions leading the ultra-poor to self-sufficiency, often sequenced like BRAC's Graduation Approach), nor is graduation language a core aspect of the program's design in any official documents. Rather, it is a multi-faceted livelihood development initiative. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://giwmscdntwo.gov.np/media/app/public/56/posts/1684843052_68.pdf, https://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/reports/nepal-poverty-alleviation-fund-project-0, https://if.ad.org/documents/48415603/49457717/Nepal+1100001450+PAF+II+Project+Completion+Report+June+2019.pdf/2295d829-3d6d-5e47-ea2c-dfca4c299aa7?t=1726609137321",
