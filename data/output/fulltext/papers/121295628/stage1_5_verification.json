Its primary function is to provide conditional cash transfers to vulnerable families to help cover basic needs and promote human capital through healthcare and educational access[3][6][7]. Although there is an ongoing policy discussion about integrating graduation and economic inclusion elements into the program, and some pilots or recommendations suggest adding these elements in the future[2][4], Takaful itself does not currently implement the full graduation approach. Specifically, it does not provide productive assets, nor does it use the multi-component approach of graduation programs (asset transfer, coaching, and cash stipend together) as core program elements. A related, but distinct, program called 'Forsa' provides productive assets and economic inclusion interventions to either Takaful recipients or near-eligible participants, but this is not part of the standard Takaful program. Therefore, Takaful is not itself a graduation or multi-component poverty program, but rather a classic conditional cash transfer scheme. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://mped.gov.eg/singlenews?id=6196&type=next&lang=en, https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2018/11/15/the-story-of-takaful-and-karama-cash-transfer-program, https://egyptssp.ifpri.info/2025/01/14/egypts-experience-bridging-cash-transfers-and-an-economic-inclusion-program-for-sustainable-social-protection/",
