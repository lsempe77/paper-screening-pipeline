Internet search found graduation programs in Ethiopia: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources confirm that Ethiopia has implemented multi-component 'graduation programs' targeting ultra-poor households. These programs include cash transfers (either lump-sum grants or regular stipends) and productive asset transfers (such as livestock or poultry), alongside training and coaching. The REST-partnered graduation program in Tigray specifically provided one-off transfers of productive assets (mainly livestock), technical training, and access to savings accounts, with no short-term cash/food transfers except those available via the national PSNP program[1][2]. SPIR is another Ethiopian graduation model that provided both lump-sum asset transfers (either cash or poultry, for example $374 in PPP dollars or $200 cash/poultry) and monthly consumption supports along with regular training and coaching[3][4][5]. These interventions have been rigorously evaluated by organizations like IPA, IFPRI, and J-PAL, documenting both cash and asset components as central program features. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/documents/working-papers/2023/wp-23-14.pdf, https://poverty-action.org/graduating-ultra-poor-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/",
