  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'New Century Rural Poverty Alleviation Plan' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: There is no direct evidence of a program called the 'New Century Rural Poverty Alleviation Plan' as a formal, branded nation-wide initiative in China, but the query clearly refers to the broad suite of official anti-poverty strategies undertaken since 2001 (including the 2001 State Council 'Outline of Development-driven Poverty Alleviation in Rural Areas' and subsequent targeted poverty alleviation policies). These efforts are not classic 'graduation programs' in the sense of the BRAC/IPA/J-PAL multi-component model (with time-limited sequencing and explicit graduation benchmarks), but are rather large-scale, government-led, multi-pronged rural poverty reduction campaigns. Evidence from official reports and analyses confirms two key components: (a) direct transfers of resources to poor households, including cash in some cases (e.g., direct subsidies, minimum living guarantee system, and party officials 'sometimes simply gave people money'[5][7]); (b) provision of productive assets or support for income-generating activities (e.g., support for migrant work, developing industries, technical training, and grants to rural areas and poor households specifically to create economic activities and assets[2][4][5]). Various forms of in-kind aid and grants to collective rural economies and individual households to foster productive capacity are well documented. However, these policies do not conform to the BRAC/J-PAL 'graduation program' model, as they are not strictly time-bound or universally sequenced, and lack an explicit graduation phase, even if their aims are similar. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=117775, https://en.qstheory.cn/2021-04/30/c_617642.htm, https://www.idcpc.gov.cn/english2023/dzwk/zgkx/202307/P020230717028601583808.pdf",
