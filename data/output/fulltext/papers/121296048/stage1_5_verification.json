  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'MAUNLAD (Maunlad na Niyugan Tugon sa Kahirapan/Progressive Coconut Farming to Address Poverty)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: A comprehensive search of authoritative and recent sources, including those from BRAC UPGI, ADB, IPA, DSWD, and DOLE, did not yield any references to a program explicitly named 'MAUNLAD (Maunlad na Niyugan Tugon sa Kahirapan/Progressive Coconut Farming to Address Poverty)', nor any variation using 'Maunlad' in the context of a graduation or ultra-poor program in the Philippines. Graduation-type programs operating in the Philippines—those supported by ADB, BRAC, IPA, and government agencies—include provincial pilots in Negros Occidental, Iloilo, Bukidnon, and Sultan Kudarat, but all refer to them as 'graduation pilot', 'graduation approach', or by other names affiliated with larger agencies, not using 'MAUNLAD'. There is also no evidence that a program by this name provides cash transfers or productive assets. It is possible that 'MAUNLAD' is a local or pilot name not included in public documentation, but there is currently no verifiable evidence to confirm its existence or characteristics as a graduation, cash, or asset transfer program. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: LOW | Sources: https://bracupgi.org/program/philippines/, https://poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/2023-07/IPA%20DOLE%20Graduation%20Final%20Report_April%202022.pdf, https://livelihood.dswd.gov.ph/storage/reports_documents/adb-brief-248-graduation-approach-livelihood-program.pdf",
