  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'South African Social Grants Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The South African Social Grants Program is a large national social protection program providing monthly cash transfers via grants such as the Child Support Grant, Old Age Pension, and others to millions of vulnerable South Africans. These are unconditional or categorical transfers without a 'graduation' component or asset transfer by design. However, there is a recent pilot project called 'Generating Better Livelihoods for Grant Recipients' (GBL), led by FinMark Trust in partnership with BRAC, DSD, SASSA, and others, which applies the BRAC graduation approach to a subset of grant beneficiaries. This GBL pilot is not yet scaled nationwide and is separate from the core Social Grants Program. The pilot adds livelihood support, skills, and economic linkage to selected social grant recipients, but as of current public information, it does not appear to include direct productive asset transfers; instead, its main focus is linkage to jobs, training, and entrepreneurship pathways. The core social grants program itself does not include a graduation or asset component, but it is now a 'platform' for this pilot graduation initiative. Thus: (1) The overall social grants program is not itself a graduation program, though there is an active pilot using this approach. (2) The program does provide cash transfers directly. (3) There is no evidence that recipients are routinely provided productive assets as part of the national grants program; the GBL pilot focuses on linkages, training, and support rather than asset transfer. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://finmark.org.za/GBL/, https://dsdnews.org/roundtable-discussion-focuses-on-graduating-social-grants-beneficiaries-out-of-poverty/, https://www.dsd.gov.za/index.php/21-latest-news/562-roundtable-discussion-focuses-on-graduating-social-grants-beneficiaries-out-of-poverty",
