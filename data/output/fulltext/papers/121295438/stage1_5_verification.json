  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Tamil Nadu Empowerment and Poverty Reduction (Pudhu Vaazhvu) Project (PVP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Pudhu Vaazhvu Project (PVP) is a multi-component poverty alleviation program implemented by the Government of Tamil Nadu with World Bank assistance. It targets the poorest of the poor, marginalized, and differently abled in rural areas, using a Community Driven Development (CDD) approach. The program is designed to empower beneficiaries by building skills, enhancing livelihoods, and promoting sustainable development, which aligns with the graduation model's focus on holistic, sequenced interventions for the ultra-poor.\n\nEvidence from multiple sources confirms that the project provides productive assets to beneficiaries. For example, the project finances demand-driven sub-project investments, which include livelihood support and asset creation, such as facilitating access to affordable credit and building market linkages to improve livelihoods. The project also implements skills training and job placement programs, which are typical components of graduation programs.\n\nHowever, there is no clear evidence in the available sources that the program provides direct cash transfers or stipends to beneficiaries. While the project supports livelihoods and may involve financial assistance, the specific provision of cash transfers is not mentioned in the reviewed documents.\n\nThe program is officially named the Tamil Nadu Empowerment and Poverty Reduction (Pudhu Vaazhvu) Project (PVP), as confirmed by government and World Bank sources. | Graduation: YES, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.allsubjectjournal.com/assets/archives/2015/vol2issue6/58.pdf, https://so-prototype.webflow.io/projects/pudhu-vaazhvu-tamil-nadu-livelihood, https://ifmrlead.org/files/OWC/Pudhu-Vazhvu-Project-Report.pdf",
