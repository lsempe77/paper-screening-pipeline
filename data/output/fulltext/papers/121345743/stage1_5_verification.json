  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Dairy Cooperative Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: There is no direct evidence found in authoritative sources confirming the existence of a formal 'Dairy Cooperative Program' in Kenya that aligns with the graduation approach (multi-component poverty alleviation targeting the ultra-poor, as defined by BRAC/J-PAL/IPA/World Bank). While there are numerous graduation and asset-transfer poverty programs in Kenya (e.g., BRAC PROFIT, BOMA REAP, Mercy Corps Nawiri) that include productive asset transfers, cash transfers, and training, none of the search results specifically mention a 'Dairy Cooperative Program' as a graduation or ultra-poor livelihood intervention. The closest linked concepts are general references to cooperatives improving livelihoods and graduation programs transferring assets (sometimes livestock), but the sources do not tie these together under the 'Dairy Cooperative Program' name nor clarify whether such a program provides cash or dairy-related productive assets. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: LOW | Sources: https://bracupgi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BRAC_PROFIT-Financial-Graduation-Report-Nov-2019.pdf, https://globalcommunities.org/country/kenya-2-2/, https://poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/2023-07/IPA%20DOLE%20Graduation%20Final%20Report_April%202022.pdf",
