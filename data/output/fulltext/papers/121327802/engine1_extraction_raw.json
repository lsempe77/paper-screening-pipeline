The paper focuses on analyzing differences between SHG and non-SHG members, but does not clearly describe specific cash transfer or asset provision components. The content provided appears to be primarily statistical tables and results rather than program description sections, making it difficult to definitively identify intervention components. I've marked both cash and asset components as false since there is no clear evidence of direct provision in the available text."
