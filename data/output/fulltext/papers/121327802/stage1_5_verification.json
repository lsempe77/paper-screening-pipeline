  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'PRADAN SHG Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The PRADAN SHG Program is primarily a large-scale initiative organizing women into Self-Help Groups (SHGs) to mobilize poor rural communities for livelihood enhancement and social empowerment. While often partnering with government and other agencies, PRADAN's direct model does not fit the technical 'graduation approach' as defined by BRAC, IPA, or J-PAL, which combines sequenced interventions for the ultra-poor (grant + asset + stipend + skills + coaching)[2][3][5]. PRADAN's core model centers on collective action, savings, facilitating bank credit, and improving access to livelihood resources. There is no direct evidence in their public documentation or impact reports of unconditional cash transfers or stipends given to individual members as in graduation programs[2][3][5]. PRADAN does work on improving agricultural and livestock livelihoods and on farm-based producer organization formation, which could entail asset provision on a project basis, but this is not universal or central to the SHG model, and is not explicitly stated as direct asset transfers to households. Therefore, the cash component is absent, and assets support is likely only in certain partnerships or projects, not systematically part of the PRADAN SHG Program. Some external programs in India use SHG networks to deliver graduation interventions (with transfer and asset provision), but these are not PRADAN's mainstream operations. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.pradan.net/overview/, https://www.pradan.net/our-impact/, https://motivationforexcellence.org/project/pradan/",
