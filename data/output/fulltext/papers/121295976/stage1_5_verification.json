  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Char Development and Settlement Project (CDSP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Char Development and Settlement Project (CDSP) is an integrated livelihood and settlement development initiative targeting poor populations living on newly accreted chars (river islands) in Bangladesh. The project aims primarily to improve livelihoods through coastal zone development, water resource management, drainage, land titling, agricultural training, and infrastructure, as outlined by IFAD and the project’s official pages. While the core activities are multi-sectoral, including technical assistance and grant-based infrastructure, there is no direct evidence from authoritative sources that CDSP provides a sequenced, time-bound approach typical of 'graduation' programs (e.g., cash stipends, asset transfers, coaching, and financial inclusion, all with a defined graduation endpoint). In contrast, the nearby Chars Livelihoods Programme (CLP) is a recognized graduation program. CDSP clearly does deliver productive assets, notably through land titling, agricultural extension, and infrastructure, particularly targeting the landless and marginalized groups. However, the available official documents and impact evaluations do not state that unconditional or conditional cash transfers or stipends are a regular component of the project's intervention package. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_Development_and_Settlement_Project, https://www.ifad.org/en/w/projects/1100001537, https://cdsp.org.bd",
