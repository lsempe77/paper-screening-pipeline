  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Resilience, Food Security and Nutrition Project (PRSAN)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: There is no direct evidence that the 'Resilience, Food Security and Nutrition Project (PRSAN)' in Burkina Faso operates as a graduation program, which typically includes a sequenced package of interventions (such as livelihoods training, productive assets, and mentorship) aimed at moving households out of extreme poverty. The references found focus on cash transfer initiatives in Burkina Faso that tackle health, nutrition, education, and vulnerability for poor households. For example, cash is used to offset transport costs for health services or as conditional cash to promote school attendance and preventive health visits[1][3]. However, none of these cash transfer programs were explicitly named PRSAN or described as including a bundled approach with productive asset transfers or livelihoods support that typifies a graduation program. Multiple sources confirm the use of cash for various social and humanitarian objectives in Burkina Faso[1][3][4], but do not identify PRSAN or provide evidence of a productive asset component, nor do they align with the graduation program model implemented by BRAC or similar agencies. There is no mention of asset distribution, productive inputs, or explicit graduation/livelihood packages tied to PRSAN. Thus, PRSAN, as per available evidence, cannot be confirmed as a graduation program, though cash is a clear component of Burkina Faso’s social protection programming. No official documentation was found to directly tie PRSAN to these components, and it is possible that the project exists under a different name or acronym, but not enough evidence exists to verify that. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: MEDIUM | Sources: https://www.calpnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cash-transfers-for-transport-to-health-centres-and-malnutrition-treatment-centres.pdf, https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/sief-trust-fund/brief/burkina-faso-does-cash-work-for-the-poor, https://bettercarenetwork.org/sites/default/files/Safety-Nets---Cash-Transfers.pdf",
