  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Western Development Program (WDP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Western Development Program (WDP), also referred to as the 'Western Development Strategy,' is an official Chinese regional development strategy launched in 2000. Its primary objectives are to address regional disparities by improving infrastructure, boosting industrial investment, and promoting economic growth in China's western provinces. There is no evidence that the WDP is a graduation program targeting ultra-poor households with a sequenced package of cash, assets, and coaching (the typical 'graduation' model). Official analyses and academic reviews describe the WDP mainly as an infrastructure and regional economic development program[1][2][5]. There is no substantiated evidence that the WDP directly provides cash transfers or productive assets to individual poor households; rather, interventions focus on large-scale public works, industry incentives, and infrastructure[1][5]. Any poverty reduction under the WDP occurs indirectly as an effect of economic development, not through targeted cash or asset provision. No mention of cash stipends or asset transfers can be located in any evaluation or description of the WDP. Programs with the tightly defined graduation model (e.g., BRAC, IPA, J-PAL evaluated interventions) are not referenced regarding the WDP. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://mosaic.messiah.edu/honors/60/, https://progressive.international/blueprint/16a350d7-9d05-49d6-b855-5de756f52963-pro-poor-development-how-china-eradicated-poverty/en/, https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/bdadc16a4f5c1c88a839c0f905cde802-0070012022/original/Poverty-Synthesis-Report-final.pdf",
