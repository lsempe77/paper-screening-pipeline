Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The 'DFID integrated livelihoods and nutrition programmes' in Bangladesh refers to the 'DFID Programme to Accelerate Improved Nutrition for the Extreme Poor in Bangladesh,' which integrates nutrition-specific interventions with pre-existing graduation/livelihood programs, notably the Chars Livelihood Programme (CLP), Economic Empowerment of the Poorest (EEP/Shiree), and Urban Partnership for Poverty Reduction (UPPR). All three base programs provided livelihoods support to extremely poor households using core graduation model components, which typically include both cash transfers and productive assets. The CLP, for example, was widely documented to provide both cash stipends and grants for productive assets such as livestock as part of its graduation approach. The integration with nutrition interventions did not alter the fundamental graduation and multi-component nature. Official evaluation and documentation confirm these design features and explicitly refer to cash and assets as key elements of the household support provided. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evaluation-of-the-dfid-programme-to-accelerate-improved-nutrition-for-the-extreme-poor-in-bangladesh, https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/articles/report/MQSUN_Mixed_Methods_Report_Impact_Evaluation_of_the_DFID_Programme_to_Accelerate_Improved_Nutrition_for_the_Extreme_Poor_in_Bangladesh_Phase_II/26473537, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a804cb1ed915d74e622da70/DFID-response-Accelerate-Improved-Nutrition-Extreme-Poor-Bangladesh.pdf",
