  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Saemaul Zero Hunger Communities Project (SZHCP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The SZHCP in Tanzania and Bangladesh is a multi-component poverty program designed by WFP and Good Neighbors International, drawing from South Korea's Saemaul Undong rural development approach. The program targeted the most vulnerable communities to improve food security, income generation, education, and infrastructure through community-based activities. There is no mention in available sources of a structured 'graduation' model as defined by BRAC's or J-PAL's ultra-poor graduation programs, which include precise sequenced supports, guaranteed cash transfers, and asset transfers designed for time-bound graduation out of poverty. While there is evidence that the SZHCP provided productive assets and supported income generation and community capacity building (e.g., agricultural input provision, infrastructure, training), there is insufficient public documentation to verify a dedicated cash transfer or stipend component. The core approach is rural development and not a graduation model; assets provision is confirmed, but cash transfers are not explicitly documented. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://goodneighbourscanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Make-the-village-better_World-Development.pdf, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scy0mrBQkQ0",
