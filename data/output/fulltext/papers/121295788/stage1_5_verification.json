  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Trickle Up (TU)'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple authoritative sources confirm that Trickle Up implements a graduation program in Burkina Faso based on the globally recognized Graduation Approach. This approach is explicitly described as supporting the ultra-poor to move out of extreme poverty through a sequenced set of components, including participant selection, savings group formation, technical and skills training, and regular coaching. Trickle Up documents and external evaluations indicate that a key step is the disbursement of individual grants (cash transfer) used to fund livelihood plans. This is further supported by evidence that seed capital/asset transfers and technical assistance are provided, with monitoring of asset use to support productive livelihoods. Evaluations reference a four-component model (savings, skills training, cash transfer, and ongoing support), confirming the delivery of both cash and productive assets as integral program features. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://trickleup.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/OurWorkBurkinaFaso_2016_10.pdf, https://www.peiglobal.org/themes/custom/pei_b5/kc_files/Karimli,%20Bose%20and%20Kagotho%202019.pdf, https://trickleup.org/our-work-burkina-faso/",
