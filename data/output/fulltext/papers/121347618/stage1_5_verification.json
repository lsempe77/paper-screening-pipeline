Available literature—including case studies and national tourism frameworks—describes it as a vehicle for local economic development, cultural preservation, and sustainable tourism. There is no credible evidence suggesting that it is structured as a graduation or multi-component poverty program in the sense used by organizations like BRAC, J-PAL, or the World Bank, nor that it targets the ultra-poor using coordinated interventions (such as stipends/cash, training, and asset transfer) that define such programs. There also is no documentation of direct cash transfer, stipend distribution, or explicit provision of productive assets as a program feature. The focus is on empowering local communities through business ownership, skills training, and income generation from tourism, but not through mechanisms characteristic of graduation approaches. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.usp.ac.fj/discipline-of-tourism-and-hospitality-management/the-team/dr-dawn-gibson/, https://mcttt.gov.fj/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NSTF-Phase-A-1.pdf, https://www.collegesidekick.com/study-docs/16783117",
