  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Transforming Household Resilience in Vulnerable Environments (THRIVE) with Empowered Worldview (EWV)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The THRIVE program in Zambia, led by World Vision, is explicitly described as a 'graduation' initiative aiming to move ultra-poor families toward economic self-reliance, aligning with characteristics of graduation programs[2][6]. Graduates are equipped with skills and productive assets (such as tailoring kits: sewing machines, scissors, fabrics, etc.), directly supporting livelihood transformation[1]. However, there is no direct evidence from public materials that THRIVE provides unconditional or conditional cash transfers/stipends to participants. Most references focus on skills training, access to productive assets, and savings groups, but do not mention cash transfer as a component[1][2][3]. Although integrated with savings for transformation, credit and entrepreneurship support, the lack of explicit mention of direct consumptive cash transfer precludes confident verification. The program's official name aligns with the sources cited. Overall, confidence is high for graduation and assets, but medium for the cash component due to missing direct evidence. | Graduation: YES, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.wvi.org/stories/zambia/farms-fabrics-empowering-vulnerable-families-through-tailoring-skills, https://www.wvi.org/stories/zambia/world-vision-zambia-livelihood-project-thrive-20-impact-over-760000-people, https://www.worldvisionphilanthropy.org/hubfs/resources/ELO/Economic%20Empowerment%20Fund.pdf",
