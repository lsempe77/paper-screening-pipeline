The 2025 BLT Kesra iteration, as well as historical BLT programs, distributes unconditional cash assistance to millions of households for consumption support purposes[1][2][3][6][8]. There is no evidence from official communications, program descriptions, or independent evaluations that BLT includes components for productive asset transfers or multi-component livelihood support (such as skills training, savings, or business assets) typical of graduation programs. While there is a separate government internship program launched in parallel with BLT Kesra, the BLT program itself does not contain elements characteristic of graduation models such as BRAC's, and is not structured as a multi-component approach.[1][2][3][4][6][8] | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.setneg.go.id/baca/index/mensesneg_blt_tambahan_dari_efisiensi_anggaran, https://www.ekon.go.id/publikasi/detail/6607/pemerintah-resmi-luncurkan-program-blt-kesejahteraan-rakyat-dan-program-magang-lulusan-perguruan-tinggi, https://setkab.go.id/pemerintah-luncurkan-bantuan-langsung-tunai-kesejahteraan-rakyat-untuk-35-juta-keluarga/",
