  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: MGNREGS is not structured as a graduation program; its primary objective is to provide a legal guarantee of 100 days of wage employment to rural households who demand it, rather than providing a sequenced package of support (cash, assets, coaching) typically found in graduation or ultra-poor programs[4][5][6]. It is a public works and employment guarantee scheme. The 'cash component' is present in the form of direct wage payments for unskilled manual labor under the scheme[4][5][6][7], and this is one of the world's largest wage-based social protection measures. The scheme also mandates the creation of 'durable assets' through labor-intensive works — this includes construction of roads, ponds, wells, and other rural infrastructure, which benefits the community and sometimes the individual households, thus 'productive assets' are a component of the program[4][5]. However, MGNREGS does not provide direct asset transfers at the household or individual level as a targeted livelihood input, but the assets built are commonly accessible and enhance livelihood productivity. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi_National_Rural_Employment_Guarantee_Act,_2005, https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S2717541324400084, https://nrega.nic.in",
