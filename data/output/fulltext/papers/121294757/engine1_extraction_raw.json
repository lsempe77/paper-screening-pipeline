While it includes poverty alleviation components, it does not follow the typical graduation approach with cash/consumption support and productive asset transfers. The main intervention is relocating households from forest areas to urban or rural areas with better infrastructure and employment opportunities. I've marked both cash and asset components as false since there's no clear evidence of direct transfers of either in the paper."
