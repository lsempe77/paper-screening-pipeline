The program's main components are relocating households, building new housing, and integrating populations into urban or peri-urban settings, rather than asset transfers or direct cash transfers. While the program aims to improve incomes and livelihoods by providing access to labor markets and social services, there is no evidence in the referenced studies or program descriptions of systematic provision of productive assets (such as livestock or equipment) as part of the core intervention[1][3][4][6]. Similarly, none of the main sources explicitly confirm routine provision of ongoing cash transfers or stipends beyond housing subsidies; most support is in the form of housing construction subsidies. Unlike 'graduation' programs (such as the BRAC model), which combine time-bound cash transfers, assets, training, and handholding, PAR primarily centers on resettlement and associated services. Therefore, it is not a graduation or multi-component poverty program by recognized international definitions. However, it is possible that some localities provided limited financial incentives or subsidies related to housing, but evidence of direct, routine cash transfers or productive asset provision is lacking. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://rard.igsnrr.ac.cn/kycg/ssciscilw/202207/W020220701553677317764.pdf, https://www.demographic-research.org/articles/volume/43/10, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40085656/",
