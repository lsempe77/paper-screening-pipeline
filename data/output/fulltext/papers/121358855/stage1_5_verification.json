  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Integrated Sustainable Land Management (ISLM) technologies program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The program referenced as 'Integrated Sustainable Land Management (ISLM) technologies program' in Ethiopia appears to be part of the broader Sustainable Land Management Project (SLMP) implemented by the Ethiopian government with support from the World Bank and other partners. The SLMP is a multi-component program focused on reducing land degradation and improving land productivity through integrated watershed management, institutional strengthening, land certification, and adoption of SLM technologies. It does not target 'ultra poor' or 'extreme poverty' graduation as its primary objective, nor is it structured as a graduation program (such as those by BRAC or similar models). There is no evidence that the program provides direct cash transfers or stipends to beneficiaries. However, it does provide productive assets in the form of land rehabilitation, soil and water conservation infrastructure, and support for adoption of SLM technologies, which are productive assets for smallholder farmers and communities. The program is not described as a cash transfer or graduation program in any of the official documentation or evaluations. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://adaptationataltitude.org/solutions-portal/sustainable-land-management-project-2-ethiopia-slmp-2/, https://www.thegef.org/projects-operations/projects/2794, https://weadapt.org/solutions-portal/sustainable-land-management-project-i-ethiopia-slmp-1/",
