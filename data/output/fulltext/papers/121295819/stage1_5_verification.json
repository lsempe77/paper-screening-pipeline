Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia is explicitly referenced as a multi-component poverty program that includes a graduation model. Multiple sources, including program documents and evaluation briefs, define 'graduation' within PSNP as households attaining food self-sufficiency and asset resilience, ceasing the need for social safety net support[3][1]. The core interventions in PSNP include regular cash (and/or food) transfers to the poorest households, providing consumption support that allows for investment in livelihoods[3][4]. Asset provision is also a clear component: documentation describes 'livelihood transfers'—either as subsidized asset or cash transfers—to help households kick-start economic activities[3][2]. Impact studies and program overviews reinforce that asset building and cash/food transfers are cornerstones of the approach. The program's targeting, transfers, skills training, and asset/livelihood support together confirm it meets the criteria of a graduation program with cash and asset components. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://www.care.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spir_learning_brief-sustainability_of_psnp_household_graduation-final_0.pdf",
