  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'SHOUHARDO III' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: SHOUHARDO III, run by CARE Bangladesh and supported by USAID, is primarily a resilience food security and livelihoods program targeting poor and extreme poor communities. Its main aims are to improve food security, nutrition, income, and resilience, particularly for women and children. The program focuses on agriculture and livelihood interventions, including training in improved agricultural technologies, livestock rearing, fisheries, and market access, as well as building local entrepreneurship through Local Service Providers' Networks. There is clear evidence that it distributes or facilitates access to productive assets—such as seeds, livestock, and aquaculture inputs—but no credible direct evidence from any detailed official program documents, evaluation reports, or organizational materials that SHOUHARDO III provides direct cash transfers or stipends to beneficiaries. Unlike 'graduation' programs (such as those run by BRAC), which integrate time-bound, multi-component supports including sustained cash transfers and assets to move ultra poor households out of poverty, SHOUHARDO III lacks explicit graduation framing and does not integrate direct cash support as a core pillar. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://careclimatechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SHOUHARDO-III-Booklet.pdf, https://alnap.hacdn.io/media/documents/SHOUHARDO-III-Final-Evaluation_Apendix.pdf, https://www.carebangladesh.org/project-details/64",
