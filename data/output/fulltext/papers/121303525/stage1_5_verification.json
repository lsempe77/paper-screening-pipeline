  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) in Kenya is a large-scale government social protection program that provides regular, unconditional cash transfers to chronically poor and food-insecure households in arid and semi-arid lands. Multiple sources confirm cash transfers as the main intervention[2][3][4][5]. The program's objective includes reducing poverty and improving resilience, and recent phases use the word 'graduate' with respect to reducing poverty, but there is no evidence HSNP implements the multi-component 'graduation approach' (cash, training, assets, coaching, etc.) as defined by programs like BRAC or IPA. HSNP does not provide productive assets (such as livestock, tools, or direct business inputs) to beneficiaries; it is purely a cash-based safety net. Evidence from program manuals, evaluations, and international reviews shows no component for distributing productive assets or livelihoods assets directly to households[2][3][4][5]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://devtracker.fcdo.gov.uk/programme/GB-GOV-1-300143/summary, https://www.calpnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kenya.pdf, https://www.ids.ac.uk/projects/kenya-hunger-safety-net-programme/",
