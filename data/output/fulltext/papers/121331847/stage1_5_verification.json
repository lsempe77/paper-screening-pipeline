According to the World Bank evaluation and project documentation, SWPRP was a large-scale multi-component rural poverty alleviation program but not a 'graduation program' as defined by BRAC or J-PAL (which feature time-bound, sequenced cash and asset transfers combined with coaching aimed at sustainable self-employment for the ultra-poor)[7]. SWPRP provided multiple interventions: cash components included direct subsidies, support for income-generating activities, microfinance, and small loans; assets support included distribution of livestock, farm inputs, construction of irrigation and water supply, roads, and the provision of equipment for productive use[7]. The program also combined substantial investments in infrastructure and social services. While cash and asset transfers (livestock, inputs) were core, there is no evidence that it followed a graduation model with structured coaching or targeting the ultra-poor for graduation, but rather it was a broad-based poverty reduction and rural development project[7]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://documents.worldbank.org/pt/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/261131468239391765/the-china-southwest-poverty-reduction-project",
