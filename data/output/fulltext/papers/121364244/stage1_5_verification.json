  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'SADA-Northern Ghana Millennium Village Project (MVP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The SADA-Northern Ghana Millennium Village Project (MVP) was a multi-component rural development program targeting poverty in Northern Ghana, but it is not classified as a 'Graduation' program. The Graduation approach, as defined by BRAC and evaluated by organizations like J-PAL and IPA, involves a sequenced package of interventions including cash or asset transfers, skills training, and social support, specifically targeting the ultra-poor. The MVP, however, focused on integrated development across sectors such as agriculture, health, education, and infrastructure, rather than the specific Graduation model. \n\nThe MVP provided productive assets such as seeds, fertilizer, and construction of grain storage facilities, as well as agricultural training and access to loans, but there is no evidence that it included direct cash transfers or stipends to beneficiaries. The program's activities included asset provision (e.g., seeds, fertilizer, storage facilities), but not cash or unconditional transfers. \n\nTherefore, the MVP is a multi-component poverty program with an assets component, but not a Graduation program and does not include a cash transfer component. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://ophi.org.uk/sites/default/files/OPHIWP130.pdf, https://pdaghana.com/download/uk-department-for-international-development-impact-evaluation-of-the-sada-millennium-villages-project-in-northern-ghana-endline-summary-report/, https://www.itad.com/project/ghana-dfid-impact-evaluation-of-mvp-sada-northern-ghana-millennium-village/",
