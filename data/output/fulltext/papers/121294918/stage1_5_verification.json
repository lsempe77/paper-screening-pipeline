Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia has integrated a graduation model, especially in recent years and through its Phase IV implementation. 'Graduation' in PSNP refers to households becoming self-sufficient and able to meet their food needs without further transfers. Multiple sources, including learning briefs and peer-reviewed literature, confirm that the PSNP provides regular cash (or food) transfers, and, in partnership with international initiatives and pilots such as SPIR, it has included a 'livelihood transfer'—typically a subsidized asset or direct asset transfer to help ultra-poor households kick-start an economic activity. These are core components of the widely cited graduation approach. Evidence includes documentation of cash transfers, skills training, savings facilitation, and the aforementioned asset or cash grants to start livelihoods. SPIR and similar projects built upon the PSNP infrastructure offer lighter-touch graduation models but still include both cash and asset transfers as core tools for breaking the poverty cycle. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://www.care.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spir_learning_brief-sustainability_of_psnp_household_graduation-final_0.pdf",
