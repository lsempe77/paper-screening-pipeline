Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple independent sources clearly verify that in Burkina Faso, a multifaceted program adhering to the graduation approach targeted ultra-poor households, often called the 'Integrated Graduation Program' or 'Multifaceted Ultra-Poor Program.' Peer-reviewed and IPA-affiliated evaluations describe a multi-arm randomized controlled trial where the program components included (1) a cash transfer only (arm T1), (2) cash transfer plus productive asset (animal transfer, arm T2), and (3) T2 plus a nutrition/gardening bundle (arm T3). The purpose and design explicitly match the graduation model: combining cash, assets, training, coaching, and additional supports to help extremely poor households become self-sufficient. There is unambiguous evidence that this program included both cash support and productive asset transfers (specifically, animals such as livestock), satisfying both required components for assessment. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/themes/custom/pei_b5/kc_files/Karimli,%20Bose%20and%20Kagotho%202019.pdf, https://poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/Beyond%20Poverty%20Reduction.pdf",
