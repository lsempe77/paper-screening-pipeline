This reduction stemmed from substantial positive impacts on livestock, agricultural equipment, number of parcels cultivated and improve financial situation. Second, only the nutrition-focused group demonstrated significant and lasting impacts on children's anthropometric measures. Beyond the direct effects of enriched flour on anthropometrics, our findings suggest that the nutrition intervention may have prompted households to allocate more resources specifically to vulnerable groups like young children, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women.
