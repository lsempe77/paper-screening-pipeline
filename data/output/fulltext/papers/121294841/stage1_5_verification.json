  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'WFP's Integrated Resilience Programme' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The WFP Integrated Resilience Programme in Niger is an integrated, multi-component program that supports vulnerable communities through interventions like land rehabilitation via food assistance for assets (FFA), school feeding, and support to smallholder farmers[1][4][3]. While there is a clear emphasis on building productive assets (via FFA and land rehabilitation), there is no direct evidence that the core program includes unconditional or conditional cash transfers or cash stipends. The graduation approach is not explicitly referenced; instead, the program focuses on improving resilience and food security through asset creation, nutrition interventions, and skill development[1][4]. Graduation in this context refers only to the transition of participants from food assistance to technical assistance (not cash grants), and there is no indication of the intensive, multi-faceted 'graduation' model (e.g., BRAC/IPA type) being used. The main asset component is land and natural resource rehabilitation as well as community productive infrastructure[1][4]. No documentation points to systematic or substantial cash transfers as a regular feature. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://reliefweb.int/report/niger/niger-annual-country-report-2023-country-strategic-plan-2020-2024, https://www.wfp.org/countries/niger, https://www.wfp.org/operations/200961-strengthening-resilience-niger-through-integrated-multi-sector-and-multi-partner",
