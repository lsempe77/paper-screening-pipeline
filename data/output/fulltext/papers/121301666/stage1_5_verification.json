  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'One Acre Fund (1AF) core program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The One Acre Fund (1AF) core program in Kenya is not classified as a graduation program as defined by the BRAC/J-PAL/World Bank model, which typically combines consumption support (often cash transfers), asset transfers, intensive coaching, and connection to savings or insurance over time in a sequenced intervention. Instead, the 1AF core program primarily provides smallholder farmers with access to agricultural inputs (such as seeds and fertilizer) delivered as a bundle on credit, alongside training, extension services, and sometimes crop insurance. Farmers repay these credits over the season, rather than receiving unconditional (or even conditional) cash transfers or direct cash stipends. Multiple sources, including comprehensive program evaluations and the organization's own documentation, state that the program does not disburse cash, but extends productive assets in the form of farm inputs and services, which are repaid after harvest. The impact reports measure increases in assets and farm income, but this comes from improved productivity due to inputs, not cash injections. Therefore, it fits as a multi-component agricultural livelihoods program, but not as a classic graduation or ultra-poor program, and it does not meet the cash transfer or direct stipend criteria. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.focusingphilanthropy.org/partner/about-one-acre-fund/, https://oneacrefund.org/sites/default/files/2023-09/Comprehensive_Impact_Report_One_Acre_Fund.pdf, https://news.atozimpact.org/why-we-invested-in-one-acre-fund-cc26944656a5",
