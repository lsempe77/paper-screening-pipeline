However, it is not a targeted poverty graduation or multi-component program in the sense defined by organizations such as BRAC, J-PAL, or the World Bank, which typically include direct interventions (such as cash transfers, productive asset distribution, and livelihood support) for ultra-poor households. There is no evidence from authoritative government or donor documents that the LSGA itself provides cash transfers or productive assets to individuals or households; its scope is administrative and regulatory, establishing rules for service provision and participatory local governance, rather than distributing direct benefits to the ultra-poor or implementing an integrated graduation approach[2][1][5][8][9]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.dfat.gov.au/sites/default/files/analysis-local-governance-nepal.pdf, https://www.herd.org.np/uploads/frontend/Publications/PublicationsAttachments1/1497429172-Localising%20Development%20-%20Highlights%20from%20Local%20Governance%20%20Act%202074.pdf, https://mofald.gov.np/mofald/userfiles/docs_9.pdf",
