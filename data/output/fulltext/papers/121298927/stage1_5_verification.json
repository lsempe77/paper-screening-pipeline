It unambiguously provides conditional and unconditional cash transfers through both base payments and public works (cash-for-work) components[1][4][7]. There is strong and consistent evidence that direct cash transfers and employment through public works are core elements of PSSN. However, the graduation status of PSSN is unclear: although some sources mention 'Cash Plus' and pilot enhancements focused on livelihoods, there is no definitive confirmation that PSSN is formally a graduation program according to the standard definition used by organizations like BRAC or J-PAL, nor is there explicit documentation about a systematic, large-scale productive assets transfer component[2][3][7]. Some interventions mention livelihood training, market access, and support, but not direct assets transfer at scale. Therefore, it is unclear whether PSSN includes productive asset provision as a regular component, or qualifies as a graduation program. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: YES, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://clear.dol.gov/Study/Tanzania-Youth-Study-Productive-Social-Safety-Net-PSSN-impact-evaluation-Endline-report-0, https://www.sdgfund.org/case-study/tanzania-joint-programme-support-tanzania%E2%80%99s-productive-social-safety-net, https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PSNN_Updated.pdf",
