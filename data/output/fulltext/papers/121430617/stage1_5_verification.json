The main focus is on welfare transfer modalities rather than multi-component or graduation programming that combines cash, assets, training, and intensive coaching typically seen in the 'graduation' approach.[8][6] Available evidence confirms cash transfers are provided, as are in-kind transfers, but there is no indication of a productive assets component (such as livestock, equipment, or bundled livelihoods grants). Graduation programs, as defined by BRAC or similar agencies, provide a package of support including assets and training, which is not present in the described experiment. The program studied here tests 'cash vs. in-kind transfers' for consumption and food security, not for longer-term livelihoods transformation through asset provision.[8][6] There is also no mention of a coaching, training, or multi-year package. Therefore, this is not a graduation/multi-component poverty program and does not include a productive asset component. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/working-paper/testing-paternalism-cash-vs-kind-transfer-rural-mexico, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/price-effects-cash-versus-kind-transfers-mexico",
