  "reasoning": "[Generic Description - No Programs Found] Paper mentions 'Multiple Indonesian social protection programs (PKH, BLT, BLSM, Rastra/BPNT)'. Search did not find relevant graduation programs in Indonesia: Perplexity search result: The specified Indonesian social protection programs are not structured as formal 'graduation' or multi-component livelihood programs (as defined by BRAC or similar organizations) but are large-scale national social assistance schemes. PKH is a conditional cash transfer program, BLT and BLSM are unconditional cash transfers, and Rastra/BPNT are food or non-cash food assistance programs transitioned to electronic benefit transfers. While PKH features a process called 'graduation,' this refers to exiting beneficiaries due to improved economic status or no longer meeting targeting criteria—not the structured livelihood graduation model involving the coordinated provision of cash, assets, and training. Although there are mentions that PKH beneficiaries may receive 'complementary benefits' such as food support or access to training and sometimes capital assistance, these are not core, universal, or well-integrated features akin to global graduation approaches (like BRAC or the World Bank's multi-component pilots). There is no evidence that any of these programs routinely provide productive assets as a component of the standard package. Multiple authoritative sources (World Bank, J-PAL, Government of Indonesia) confirm these as cash and food transfer schemes, with only sporadic or pilot linkage to additional support (such as training or capital), but not asset transfers. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099600112222138712/pdf/P1605900c895a70fc08b1f0d201c77430b5.pdf, https://setkab.go.id/en/govt-launches-direct-cash-assistance-for-35-million-families/, https://www.povertyactionlab.org/blog/5-19-21/reforming-indonesias-largest-food-assistance-program-rastra-bpnt",
