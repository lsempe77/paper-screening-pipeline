  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI) in Bangladesh was a pilot safety net program and impact evaluation conducted by IFPRI and the World Food Programme from 2012-2014. TMRI provided monthly cash or food transfers to mothers of young children in ultra-poor rural households, with or without additional nutrition behavior change communication (BCC). There is clear evidence that the program included a cash transfer component. TMRI is not classified as a graduation or multi-component poverty program because it did not provide productive asset transfers, nor did it offer the broader package of support typical of graduation programs (such as productive assets, business skills training, and long-term coaching) that enable a shift to sustainable livelihoods. The interventions tested were monthly food or cash transfers and nutrition BCC only, not asset grants or livelihoods packages. There is no evidence TMRI recipients received productive asset transfers as part of this program. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.ifpri.org/project/transfer-modality-research-initiative-tmri/, https://voxdev.org/topic/health/how-programme-design-and-local-context-shape-lasting-effects-cash-and-food-transfers, https://bangladesh.ifpri.info/transfer-modality-research-initiative-tmri/",
