The project's design involved multisectoral interventions, including health, education, agriculture, infrastructure, and nutrition, but there is no evidence in evaluation reports or academic analyses indicating the hallmark 'graduation approach'—structured, time-bound processes focused specifically on moving the ultra-poor to sustainable livelihoods via coordinated cash transfers, productive asset transfers, and mentoring as typified by BRAC models[3][5][6][7]. No documentation from flagship evaluations or published studies reference SADA-MVP as a graduation program.\n\nNone of the sources reviewed, including external impact evaluations and cost-effectiveness analyses, make any mention of cash transfers or stipends as a program component. The intervention is repeatedly described as providing 'things' (such as schools, clinics, agricultural inputs, and health supplies), but not direct cash or income support[3][5][6][7]. Likewise, there is no mention of the systematic transfer of productive assets (such as livestock or working capital grants) to households, as would be a core component of a graduation program[3][5][6][7].\n\nIt is critical to note that there was a separate, unrelated graduation program rigorously evaluated in northern Ghana, but this was not the SADA-MVP; it was a much smaller pilot explicitly based on BRAC’s model and including productive asset and cash components[2][4]. Mixing evidence from the latter would be incorrect, as all available data clearly distinguish between the SADA-MVP’s integrated development model and stand-alone graduation approaches. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pdaghana.com/download/uk-department-for-international-development-impact-evaluation-of-the-sada-millennium-villages-project-in-northern-ghana-endline-summary-report/, https://www.itad.com/project/ghana-dfid-impact-evaluation-of-mvp-sada-northern-ghana-millennium-village/, https://repositorio.uam.es/handle/10486/717205",
