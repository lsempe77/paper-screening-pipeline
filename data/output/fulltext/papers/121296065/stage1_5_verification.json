  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Child Grant Programme (CGP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Child Grant Programme (CGP) in Zambia is an unconditional cash transfer program targeted at ultra-poor households with children under age five. Its primary design is to provide a regular monthly cash stipend to help reduce extreme poverty and improve social outcomes; it does not include a dedicated assets transfer or explicit livelihood support as in graduation models. Multiple sources confirm the cash nature of the transfer, with no mention of direct provision of productive assets. Impact evaluations of the CGP highlight improvements in food consumption, education, and some asset accumulation indirectly (households may purchase assets on their own), but there is no evidence of a bundled, multi-component approach characteristic of graduation programs, nor any asset package or livelihood training provided as part of the program. Further, studies emphasize that the CGP alone has not achieved 'graduation' from poverty, which aligns with it not being a graduation program per the standard definition. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6711746/, https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/zambia/, https://www.fao.org/4/i3692e/i3692e.pdf",
