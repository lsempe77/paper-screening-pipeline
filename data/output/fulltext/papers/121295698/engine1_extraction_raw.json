It does not include cash transfers or asset transfers as components - instead it focuses on training farmers on agricultural technologies. Therefore, both component_a_present and component_b_present are marked as false since this is not a cash/asset transfer program.\n\nThe study examines how agricultural technologies spread from trained \"key farmers\" to other farmers through social networks, but does not involve direct provision of productive assets or cash support to participants. The intervention is purely focused on training and knowledge transfer."
