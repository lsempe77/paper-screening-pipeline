  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'TANRICE training program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The TANRICE training program in Tanzania, as evidenced by official JICA and agriculture sector documents, is a technical assistance and training initiative aimed at improving rice cultivation practices through extension services, capacity building, and practical demonstrations for irrigation scheme management[3][5]. There is no indication it targets ultra-poor populations, offers cash transfers or stipends, or provides productive asset transfers; its interventions are knowledge and skills-based. Graduation or multi-component programs, in contrast, explicitly combine livelihoods training with targeted cash transfers and asset provision to the ultra-poor, modeled on programs like BRAC's Ultra Poor Graduation approach[1][2][4]. TANRICE does not match these criteria and is not cited as part of social protection or poverty graduation literature. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://riceforafrica.net/joomla/downloads/Meetings/seminar/JICA-West-Africa2012/14-2.Tanzania_Training_based_rice_extension_EN19Sep2012.pdf, https://www2.jica.go.jp/en/evaluation/pdf/2022_1200060_4_f.pdf",
