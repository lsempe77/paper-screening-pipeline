  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'China's poverty reduction program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: China's major national poverty reduction initiative, known officially as the 'Targeted Poverty Alleviation' (TPA) program, is a comprehensive, multi-dimensional approach to poverty eradication focusing on social assistance, education, infrastructure, and livelihood support[1][5]. While the program shares some characteristics with graduation or multi-component approaches—such as aiming for sustainable livelihoods and tackling multiple poverty dimensions—there is no direct evidence in available sources that China's TPA is formally based on the graduation model as defined by BRAC, J-PAL, or IPA, nor is it typically described in this terminology by leading researchers or organizations. However, TPA did include substantial cash transfer components (such as Minimum Living Standard Guarantees, scholarships, and social assistance) and asset/livelihood transfer components (such as job creation, micro-loans, subsidies for agricultural inputs, livestock, and training)[1][5]. The combination of cash transfers and productive asset support is clearly documented, but the 'graduation' label and sequencing are not explicitly present, and leading global overviews of graduation pilots and programs do not cite China as an example[3][4][6]. Thus, while its methods overlap somewhat with graduation programs, it is not classified as such by authoritative sources. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://thetricontinental.org/studies-1-socialist-construction/, https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/bdadc16a4f5c1c88a839c0f905cde802-0070012022/original/Poverty-Synthesis-Report-final.pdf, https://poverty-action.org/ultra-poor-graduation-approach",
