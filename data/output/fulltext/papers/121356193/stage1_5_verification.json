Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: AgricYES in Nigeria is empirically shown to be an economic development program targeting youth, structured to reduce poverty and improve welfare through multi-component support. According to the cited impact evaluation, participation led to increased monthly per capita expenditure and enhanced asset ownership among beneficiaries — key outcomes aligned with graduation program models. The scheme is referred to as a sustainable livelihood initiative, and it started in 2010 in southwestern Nigeria[2]. The program involves 'asset ownership' and increased cash expenditures, confirming both productive assets and cash transfer components for participants. Although it does not use the specific term 'graduation program' in international best-practice sense (e.g., BRAC/IPA models), it operates with similar multi-component objectives (cash, assets, capacity-building, and linking to improved livelihoods) and is recommended for economic-driven youth upliftment and poverty reduction. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.ejosdr.com/download/impact-of-government-agricultural-empowerment-scheme-on-expenditure-and-poverty-of-youth-in-nigeria-16348.pdf",
