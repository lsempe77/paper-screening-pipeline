Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia includes a strong graduation focus, with interventions and benchmarks explicitly designed to help households exit poverty sustainably[1][2][3][5][6]. Graduation is based on achieving certain livelihood and asset thresholds, particularly livestock and crop production, and beneficiaries are expected to move toward food self-sufficiency, often measured through asset accumulation[3][5][6]. The Public Works Component provides cash and/or food transfers to beneficiaries in exchange for labor on community projects, so cash transfers are a core feature of the program[3][1]. Additionally, productive assets (especially livestock and inputs for agricultural production) are integral both as graduation benchmarks and as components supported via complementary livelihoods interventions within or layered onto the PSNP[3][2][5][6]. The PSNP has also partnered with organizations (e.g., BRAC, Ford Foundation, REST) to deliver graduation pilots that explicitly include asset transfers[2]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://essp.ifpri.info/2025/10/13/graduating-from-ethiopias-productive-safety-net-programme-what-have-we-learned/, https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10844108/",
