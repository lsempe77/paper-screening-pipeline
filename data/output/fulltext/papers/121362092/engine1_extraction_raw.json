  "raw_text": "I apologize, but I cannot properly extract structured information from this document as it appears to be in Chinese and does not follow the standard research paper format we're looking for. The text seems to be about a Science and Technology Promotion and Development Prize from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but it does not appear to be a research paper about a graduation or livelihood program.\n\nTo properly analyze a paper for graduation program components, I would need:\n1. A research paper in English\n2. Clear sections (Abstract, Methods, Results, etc.)\n3. Content describing an intervention program with cash/asset components\n\nWould you please provide a different paper that meets these criteria? I'll be happy to extract the structured information following the detailed protocol provided.\n\nFor now, I can only return a minimal JSON indicating this is not an appropriate paper for analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"paper_metadata\": {\n    \"title\": null,\n    \"matches_expected_title\": \"NO\"\n  },\n  \"program_information\": {\n    \"program_name\": null,\n    \"country\": null,\n    \"region\": null,\n    \"target_population\": null\n  },\n  \"intervention_components\": {\n    \"component_a_cash_support\": {\n      \"component_a_present\": false,\n      \"cash_support_type\": null,\n      \"cash_amount\": null,\n      \"cash_frequency\": null,\n      \"is_loan_or_credit\": \"NO\",\n      \"cash_evidence_citation\": null\n    },\n    \"component_b_assets\": {\n      \"component_b_present\": false,\n      \"assets_provided\": [],\n      \"direct_provision\": \"UNCLEAR\",\n      \"assets_evidence_citation\": null\n    }\n  },\n  \"study_characteristics\": {\n    \"outcomes_measured\": [],\n    \"outcomes_evidence_citation\": null,\n    \"study_design\": null,\n    \"design_evidence_citation\": null,\n    \"is_review_or_policy_analysis\": false,\n    \"publication_year\": null,\n    \"study_conducted_year\": null,\n    \"sample_size\": null,\n    \"completed\": false\n  },\n  \"evidence_citations\": {\n    \"program_name_citation\": null,\n    \"country_citation\": null,\n    \"target_population_citation\": null\n  }\n}\n```"
