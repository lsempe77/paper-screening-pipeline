Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Food Security Programme (FSP) in Ethiopia is a multi-component poverty program that includes the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) as its flagship component. Graduation from the program is a key goal, with explicit objectives to move households out of chronic food insecurity and reduce dependency on transfers. The program provides both cash transfers and productive assets to beneficiaries. The PSNP, which is part of the FSP, offers cash or food transfers to eligible households, and the Household Asset Building Programme (HABP) component provides productive assets such as livestock, tools, and other inputs to help households build sustainable livelihoods. Evidence from multiple sources confirms that the FSP aims for graduation, provides cash transfers, and includes asset-building components. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a089d940f0b649740002c8/FAC_Working_Paper_080.pdf, https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/articles/report/Assessing_Enablers_and_Constrainers_of_Graduation_Evidence_from_the_Food_Security_Programme_Ethiopia/26449063, https://cgspace.cgiar.org/items/13ccf0d2-85e1-4547-a268-a53c054fd3be",
