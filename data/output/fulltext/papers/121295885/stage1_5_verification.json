  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: ICDS in India is a large-scale, ongoing government welfare program focused on providing nutrition, healthcare, and preschool education to children under 6 and pregnant/lactating mothers. Its core services include supplementary nutrition, health check-ups, immunization, nutrition/health education, referral services, and non-formal pre-school education through Anganwadi centers[1][2][3][4][5][6]. There is no evidence that ICDS functions as a 'graduation program'—defined as a multi-component program for ultra-poor households with a pathway out of extreme poverty, combining cash transfers, productive assets, and livelihood training, as seen in BRAC, J-PAL, or IPA models. ICDS provides in-kind food (supplementary nutrition) and basic services, not cash transfers or stipends, nor the provision of productive assets or direct livelihood support[2][3][4][5]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://chdsw.gov.in/index.php/scheme/ICDS, https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/icds/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Child_Development_Services",
