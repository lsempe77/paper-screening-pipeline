  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Kalobeyei Settlement Development Program'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources confirm that the Kalobeyei Settlement Development Program in Kenya utilizes a poverty graduation approach specifically adapted for refugees and host communities. According to BOMA's impact report, BOMA implements tailored graduation and economic inclusion models at the Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement that involve providing capital (typically lump-sum cash grants), training, business mentorship, and support for starting small, sustainable businesses, including green agricultural initiatives[1]. The program's components—capital transfers, coaching, and productive asset creation—are aligned with the standard graduation model used globally by organizations such as BRAC, J-PAL, and UNHCR. Additional documentation on the Kalobeyei initiative indicates residents receive cash-based assistance through instruments such as Bamba Chakula (a debit card for food purchases) and are encouraged to cultivate homestead gardens and start micro-enterprises[2]. These details provide clear evidence of both cash transfer and productive asset components. While the term 'Kalobeyei Settlement Development Program' is sometimes used interchangeably with multi-partner efforts (including the Kalobeyei Integrated Socio Economic Development Plan, or KISEDP), direct programmatic approaches described fit the graduation program definition, and evidence of cash and productive asset support is documented. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://boma.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BOMA-2024-Q2-Impact-Report.pdf, https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Barriers-to-education-in-Kakuma-Refugee-Camp.pdf, https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/85c717bf-e1cd-574a-ab79-d9a074dceca1",
