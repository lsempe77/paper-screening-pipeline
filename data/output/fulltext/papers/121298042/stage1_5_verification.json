Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: China’s main national poverty alleviation policy, officially known as the Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program, is a multi-component, household-targeted intervention broadly consistent with a 'graduation'-type approach. The program identifies poor households, assigns each household a government cadre for tailored support, and delivers a package of measures including cash transfers, productive asset support (such as agricultural subsidies, microcredit, and infrastructure), vocational training, and more. Numerous analyses note both direct cash transfers and asset-building components, such as subsidies for livestock, land, or small businesses, are core methods for supporting families to rise above poverty and sustain their livelihoods. Academic evaluations and government sources confirm these elements. The program goes beyond simple income transfers by combining multiple inputs to support sustainable graduation from poverty. There is robust documentation from scholarly and multilateral sources confirming both cash and productive asset components. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://sccei.fsi.stanford.edu/china-briefs/how-participation-chinas-poverty-alleviation-campaign-affected-firm-performance-and, http://ae.ruc.edu.cn/docs/2023-05/06cfed579652429f9a5f9952bcb3579f.pdf",
