Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Food Security Programme (FSP) in Ethiopia is a multi-component poverty program with an explicit graduation objective. It integrates the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP), which provides cash (and sometimes food) transfers to chronically food-insecure households, and the Household Asset Building Programme (HABP), which delivers productive asset transfers and livelihood support[1][2][3]. Key program documents and evaluations indicate that the graduation pathway involves sequencing both consumption support (mainly through PSNP cash transfers or public works wages) and productive asset transfers (mainly through HABP), aiming to build resilience and enable households to move out of chronic food insecurity[1][2][3]. The official program name is 'Food Security Programme (FSP)', which encompasses these components. Multiple government and donor sources confirm this structure and graduation orientation of the FSP. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a089d940f0b649740002c8/FAC_Working_Paper_080.pdf, https://www.fordfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pdf9-ethiopia_final.pdf, https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/p2p/Publications/presentations/FSP_presentation_at_Accra_Ghana.pdf",
