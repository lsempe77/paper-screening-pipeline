Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The CGAP-Ford Foundation Graduation Program is widely documented as a graduation program designed to help the extreme poor transition out of poverty through a multi-component approach. Multiple authoritative sources, including the World Bank and Ford Foundation, describe it as a time-bound, multi-component poverty program tested across multiple countries. Its methodology consistently features five core elements: targeted selection, cash/consumption support, savings, skills training and regular coaching, and a productive asset transfer. Official descriptions from the World Bank and CGAP confirm both a cash transfers/consumption support element and a provision of productive assets as part of the core package. Pilot and scale-up evaluations reinforce these points, affirming the intent to provide an integrated package to enable sustained exit from extreme poverty, addressing both immediate needs (consumption support) and longer-term livelihoods (productive assets). | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2013/04/04/graduation-program-creating-pathways-out-of-extreme-poverty-into-sustainable-livelihoods, https://www.cgap.org/sites/default/files/graduation_guide_final.pdf, https://www.cgap.org/sites/default/files/CGAP-Focus-Note-Reaching-the-Poorest-Lessons-from-the-Graduation-Model-Mar-2011.pdf",
