These counties serve as core administrative units for poverty alleviation interventions, receiving increased fiscal expenditure and government resources to boost development and reduce poverty[1][7]. The program focuses on targeted identification of poor individuals and households, resource allocation, infrastructure, education, health services improvements, and bureaucratic accountability[1][2][3][5][6][7]. While these counties receive increased funding and support, there is no direct evidence from authoritative sources indicating that the program itself universally or primarily provides direct cash transfers or stipends to households as a core component—cash transfers may exist at the household level through other programs, but they are not the core of the county designation scheme[1][2][9]. Similarly, the program does not primarily provide productive assets to households as in classic 'graduation' programs (e.g., BRAC model), nor is it designed as a multi-component household-level graduation intervention[1][2][3][9]. Instead, the TPA program operates as an administrative targeting mechanism that channels resources and supportive initiatives to designated areas, focusing more on systemic support and capacity building than on direct transfers of cash or assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.china-ces.org/Files/3058abstract/202412170201434113.pdf, https://www.cpifa.org/en/cms/book/336, https://thetricontinental.org/studies-1-socialist-construction/",
