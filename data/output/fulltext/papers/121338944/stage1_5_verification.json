Its core mechanisms are transfer funds (APBN to APBD allocations), tax reforms, and performance incentives at the local government level. There is no evidence from official reviews, legal texts, or impact analyses that the Fiscal Decentralization Policy operates as a graduation program or as a direct anti-poverty intervention providing household-level cash transfers or productive assets. Rather, fiscal decentralization changes how funds are distributed to local governments but does not itself entail programmatic delivery of stipends or targeted asset transfers to ultra-poor or vulnerable populations—those activities would require dedicated social protection or livelihood/graduation components, which are not part of the Fiscal Decentralization Policy by design or implementation. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://fiskal.kemenkeu.go.id/files/buku/file/1670915701_2_dekade_desentralisasi_fiskal_letter_-_eng.pdf, https://decentralization.net/2023/10/indonesias-new-fiscal-decentralization-law-a-critical-assessment/, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00074918.2023.2180838",
