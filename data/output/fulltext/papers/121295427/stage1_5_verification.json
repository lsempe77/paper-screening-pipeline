Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia is a large-scale social protection program aiming to assist chronically food-insecure households, mainly through a combination of public works and direct support. Numerous sources explicitly refer to 'graduation' as both an objective and a process within PSNP, defined as attaining food security and asset benchmarks so households no longer need transfers. The PSNP also integrated graduation models—including approaches adapted from the BRAC and CGAP-Ford Foundation graduation pilots—that combine cash (and/or food) transfers, livelihood support, and productive assets[1][2][4]. The program consistently provides cash (or food) transfers to beneficiaries, primarily through public works participation or direct support[7]. Additionally, asset accumulation is both a key criterion for graduation and a direct aim of the program; households are supported in acquiring productive assets such as livestock, land improvements, or off-farm businesses through various program components and linkage to credit and asset packages[3][4][5][6]. Thus, PSNP is not only foundationally a multi-component poverty and graduation program but also contains both cash transfer and productive asset components by design. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/pathways-out-productive-safety-net-programme-lessons-graduation-pilot-ethiopia, https://essp.ifpri.info/2025/10/13/graduating-from-ethiopias-productive-safety-net-programme-what-have-we-learned/, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10844108/",
