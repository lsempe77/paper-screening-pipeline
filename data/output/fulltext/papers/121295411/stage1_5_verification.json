Multiple studies confirm that these interventions typically involve education, promotion of point-of-use water treatment, and community mobilization rather than providing direct economic aid. There is no evidence that these interventions function as graduation or multi-component poverty programs, which would integrate livelihood, asset transfer, and cash transfer components. None of the reviewed studies or program reports mention delivering cash transfers or productive assets as part of the intervention; focus is routinely on behavioral change, education, and sometimes minor hardware (e.g., water purification tablets, distribution of water storage containers) but not on economic or productive asset transfers. This contrasts with graduation programs that target extreme poverty through comprehensive multi-sector economic interventions. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32076370/, https://bioone.org/journals/environmental-health-insights/volume-15/issue-1/11786302211060150/Household-Water-Treatment-Practice-and-Associated-Factors-in-Gibe-District/10.1177/11786302211060150.full, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37084492/",
