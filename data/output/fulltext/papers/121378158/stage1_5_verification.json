Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Livelihoods Transfer Program in Ethiopia refers to the implementation of a 'graduation model' aiming to move households out of extreme poverty through multi-component interventions. This model, especially under the SPIR initiative linked to Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), includes both cash and productive asset transfers to extremely poor households. According to a recent IFPRI evaluation, the program delivered both 'cash and poultry asset transfers' as core elements, alongside training and savings group participation[1]. The World Bank and Ford Foundation reports further clarify that the Ethiopian graduation pilots and scale-ups typically consist of asset transfers (e.g., livestock/poultry) and regular monthly cash payments for consumption support[2][4]. These components define it as a graduation program. Evidence from multiple sources confirms these elements are present in Ethiopia’s approach, distinguishing it from programs providing only cash transfers or limited support. The program is sometimes referred to by different names (SPIR graduation model, PSNP graduation, Ultra-Poor Graduation), but 'Livelihoods Transfer Program' is used as a descriptive label in research and policy documents. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.ifpri.org/blog/can-light-touch-graduation-model-address-persistent-poverty-evidence-ethiopia/, https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2013/04/04/graduation-program-creating-pathways-out-of-extreme-poverty-into-sustainable-livelihoods, https://www.fordfoundation.org/learning/library/research-reports/graduation-approach-case-study-ethiopia/",
