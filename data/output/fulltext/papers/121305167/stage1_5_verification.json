Its core activities revolve around forming groups for savings and facilitating access to small loans for microenterprise and consumption smoothing[3][4][8][9]. This model differs fundamentally from the 'graduation approach' programs (such as BRAC's Ultra-Poor Graduation), which sequence multiple components including time-bound cash/consumption support, asset transfers (e.g., livestock or goods), training, and targeted 'graduation' criteria. SHG programs do not typically provide cash transfers or direct productive asset transfers; instead, they enable members to mobilize their own savings and access group-negotiated or bank-facilitated loans. Most sources and program evaluations emphasize that SHGs promote group savings and credit/loan access—not unconditional or regular stipends, nor free asset distribution[3][4][8][9]. There is also no evidence in the search results or recent literature that standard SHG microfinance in India incorporates direct elements of the graduation model such as time-limited cash or asset grants, although SHG platforms have sometimes been used as channels for other government benefits (not the core function). Therefore, based on available evidence, SHG microfinance in India is not a graduation program, nor does it systematically provide cash transfers or productive assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7437468/, https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0237519, https://myrada.org/self-help-affinity-groups-sags-their-role-in-poverty-reduction-and-financial-sector-development/",
