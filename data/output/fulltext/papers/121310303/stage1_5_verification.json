  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Early Child Development (ECD) intervention adapted from National Wawa Wasi programme' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Wawa Wasi National Programme was a public early childhood development program in Peru focused on providing holistic child care, nutrition, early education, and parental support to children under four years old living in poverty. The program's main interventions included providing a safe development environment, promoting early learning, and supporting parental practices. There is no indication in official reports or program descriptions that it sought to provide regular cash transfers or stipends to beneficiary families, nor does it appear to distribute productive assets for household economic advancement. While 'Mother-Carers' (Madres Cuidadoras) received a modest payment, this was a wage for their caregiving services rather than a cash transfer for poverty alleviation. The program does not fit the definition of a 'graduation' program, which typically combines cash and productive assets targeted at ultra-poor households to promote sustainable livelihoods. The Wawa Wasi program, or versions adapted from it, is not referenced as part of a multi-component graduation or extreme poverty program by authoritative sources such as the World Bank, J-PAL, or IPA. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: http://www.ninosdelmilenio.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wp51.pdf, https://www.r4d.org/wp-content/uploads/Full-report-Cuna-Mas-country-study.pdf, https://vanleerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Early-learning-Lessons-from-scaling-upc7c7.pdf",
