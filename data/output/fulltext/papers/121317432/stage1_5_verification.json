Their primary aim is to promote sustainable use of natural resources by local communities, enhance household-level benefits, and support conservation goals. According to evaluations and program descriptions, these programs provide communities with access to productive assets, such as land rights, wildlife use quotas, and proceeds from natural resource management (e.g., tourism revenues, hunting fees)[1][3][4]. There is no evidence from program evaluations or documentation that these are 'graduation programs' in the BRAC/J-PAL sense, with multi-component design targeting ultra-poor households to 'graduate' out of poverty via sequential cash/stipend plus productive asset provision[1][3][4]. Furthermore, there is no clear indication these programs include direct cash transfers or regular stipends to individuals; instead, income derives from community-level benefit sharing, not personal grants to households[1][3][4]. The central intervention of both programs is the transfer or co-management of resource rights (land, wildlife, revenues), which constitutes access to productive assets. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://connecting-africa.net/query_2.php?rid=B00057748, https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/publications/evaluating-the-household-level-outcomes-of-community-based-natura, https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/17503FIIED.pdf",
