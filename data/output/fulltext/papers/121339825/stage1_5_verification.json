  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Public Works Employment Programs'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Several authoritative sources confirm that the Public Works Employment Programs, specifically the DOLE Ultra-Poor Graduation Pilot in the Philippines, meet the criteria for a graduation program. The program was co-developed by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) with the Asian Development Bank and technical support from BRAC UPGI, directly referencing the graduation approach. It provided a sequenced package including: (1) conditional cash transfers through the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, (2) productive asset transfers (valued at ~$300 per household), (3) livelihood skills training, coaching, and financial inclusion interventions. The impact evaluation measured the program specifically against graduation benchmarks, and 71% of participants achieved graduation criteria. Thus, it is both a graduation program and contains distinct cash and productive asset components. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://bracupgi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DOLE-Philippines-Graduation-Country-Brief-Final.pdf, https://bracupgi.org/program/philippines/, https://poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/2023-07/IPA%20DOLE%20Graduation%20Final%20Report_April%202022.pdf",
