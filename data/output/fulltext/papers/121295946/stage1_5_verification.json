Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: The 'Livelihood development programme for the ultra-poor' in Bangladesh matches BRAC’s 'Targeting the Ultra-Poor' or 'Ultra-Poor Graduation' programme, a widely studied and internationally recognized graduation program. According to multiple credible sources, including UN reports, peer-reviewed research, and program briefs, this program combines productive asset transfers (such as livestock or business inputs), temporary consumption stipends or cash transfers, life and technical skills training, healthcare, savings support, and close supervision to support participants out of extreme poverty[1][2][3][4]. Explicit documentation confirms both a time-limited cash/consumption support (cash transfers or stipends) and a sizable productive asset grant as core elements of the program design[1][2][3]. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/04/Lamia-Rashid-BRAC-Ultrapoor-Graduation-Paper-for-UN-Expert-Group-Meeting-May-2017-25Apr17.pdf, https://www.peiglobal.org/knowledge-center/targeting-ultra-poor-program-brief-challenging-frontiers-poverty, https://www.fordfoundation.org/learning/library/program-evaluations/graduation-approach-synthesis-and-four-case-studies-english/",
