  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Cassava value adding technology training program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The program described as the Cassava value adding technology training program in Nigeria is organized primarily by AATF with NRCRI, under the broader Mechanization of Cassava Production and Processing Project. Multiple sources confirm that it is a skills training initiative focusing on good agronomic practices, value addition, farm mechanization, and financial literacy. Nowhere in authoritative descriptions is there mention of direct cash transfers, stipends, nor provision of actual productive assets to beneficiaries. The explicit aims are knowledge, skill, and capacity building. The program emphasizes improved livelihoods through training, not through direct income support or asset distribution, and it is not described as a 'graduation' or multi-component ultra-poor poverty reduction program of the BRAC or World Bank type. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.aatf-africa.org/aatf-launches-good-agronomic-practices-gap-training-program-for-nigerian-cassava-farmers/, https://africasti.net/nigerian-farmers-get-advanced-training-on-high-quality-cassava-farming-processing/, https://www.tridge.com/news/aatf-launches-good-agronomic-practices-gap-t-rgojwv",
