The available evidence shows that PRONAF provides subsidized credit—not unconditional or conditional cash transfers—to support agricultural production and allow the purchase of productive assets, such as livestock and equipment. There is no indication in authoritative sources that PRONAF provides plain cash transfers or stipends unrelated to farming activities. The program is thus a sectoral credit-supported rural development initiative rather than a graduation or multi-component poverty program akin to those following the BRAC or J-PAL graduation model, which typically combine cash, assets, training, and mentoring. PRONAF's main intervention is rural credit, used to acquire productive assets, evidenced by research highlighting its use for livestock acquisition and related investments. It is not designed with a sequenced graduation approach for the ultra-poor, but rather to increase the productivity and incomes of family farmers who can qualify for credit. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12522420/, https://revistasober.org/article/10.1590/1806-9479.2023.273994/pdf/resr-62-3-e273994.pdf, https://policybasket.endhungerandpoverty.org/index.php/Brazil:_Program_for_Strengthening_Family_Farming_(PRONAF)",
