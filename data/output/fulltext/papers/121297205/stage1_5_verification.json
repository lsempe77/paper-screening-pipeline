  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'International Fund for Agricultural Development-Value Chain Development Programme (IFAD-VCDP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The IFAD Value Chain Development Programme in Nigeria is focused on poverty reduction and rural economic development primarily through enhancing cassava and rice value chains[2][3][5][6]. It supports poor rural households with farm input subsidies, training, mechanization equipment, and market integration. However, there is no indication that it follows the holistic, time-bound, multi-component 'graduation program' model (combining cash transfers, intensive coaching, and productive asset provision for the ultra-poor) exemplified by BRAC and other recognized graduation interventions[2][3][5]. While the program does provide or subsidize productive assets (such as mechanization equipment, inputs, and upgrades of production/processing technology)[3][4][5], evidence of regular or unconditional cash stipends or transfers to beneficiaries is not directly cited in available documentation—financial support appears to be project-based, including matching grants and input subsidies, but not classic cash transfers as found in graduation programs[2][3][4][5]. Therefore, while asset provision is clear, the cash component cannot be definitively verified and the program does not meet graduation program criteria. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.ifad.org/en/w/projects/1100001594, https://www.allmultidisciplinaryjournal.com/uploads/archives/20250625191706_MGE-2025-3-399.1.pdf, https://www.ifad.org/documents/48415603/50527856/NGA_1100001594_SUPERVISION_REPORT_NOV_2024_0024-811606050-2136.pdf/2e8faa06-41c1-58aa-9587-9f1dcd20726f?t=1736953306476",
