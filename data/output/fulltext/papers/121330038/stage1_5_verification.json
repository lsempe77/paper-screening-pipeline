  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'PNPM Mandiri (National Programme for Community Empowerment)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: PNPM Mandiri is Indonesia’s flagship National Program for Community Empowerment, structured as a large-scale community-driven development (CDD) initiative, not as a graduation program in the sense defined by BRAC or the international 'graduation approach' literature. PNPM Mandiri primarily channels block grants directly to communities for collective projects and public goods, including infrastructure, social programs, and occasionally small economic activities. There is a clear cash transfer component because PNPM provides direct disbursement of funds to community groups or village accounts for sub-projects, as confirmed by multiple evaluations. However, there is limited and ambiguous evidence on systematic, program-wide provision of productive assets to ultra-poor households in the individualized, asset-transfer sense typical of graduation programs. Components such as PNPM Generasi and some livelihoods subprojects may indirectly fund productive activities, but the core design remains grant-based, often at the group/community rather than household level. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transformasiglobal.ub.ac.id/index.php/trans/article/download/26/40, https://www.effectivecooperation.org/system/files/2021-06/GDI%20Case%20Study%20Community%20Empowerment%20In%20Indonesia.pdf, https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/linked-documents/46420-002-sd-04.pdf",
