Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources confirm that the 'Economic strengthening and family coaching intervention' in Burkina Faso is a graduation-style program modeled after global graduation approaches. It combines economic strengthening (integration into savings groups, training and livelihood planning, and grants for productive assets) with family coaching and sensitization. The program, implemented by Trickle Up and evaluated in peer-reviewed studies, includes a cash (grant) component of approximately $100 to jumpstart livelihood activities, sequenced technical training, savings facilitation, and ongoing coaching. There is clear documentation that both cash grants and productive assets for livelihoods are integral to the intervention. Reputable studies and evaluation briefs further confirm the delivery of these components and the framing of the intervention as a graduation program targeting ultra-poor households. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/themes/custom/pei_b5/kc_files/Karimli,%20Bose%20and%20Kagotho%202019.pdf, https://theevaluationfund.net/projects/reducing-violence-against-children-in-low-income-settings-through-economic-strengthening-and-caregiver-support/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29273116/",
