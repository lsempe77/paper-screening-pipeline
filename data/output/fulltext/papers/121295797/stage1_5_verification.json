  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'National Human Development Initiative (INDH)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The National Human Development Initiative (INDH) is Morocco’s flagship social and human development program, targeting poverty and promoting human capital through infrastructure development, access to health and education, and support to income-generating activities[1][2][3][4]. While the program is multi-sectoral and includes support for economic inclusion of the poor and marginalized, there is no direct evidence in public sources that INDH follows the 'graduation' model protocols such as those pioneered by BRAC or IPA (e.g., multicomponent packages combining cash transfers, assets, training and coaching for the ultra-poor)[2][3]. Impact evaluations and program descriptions focus mainly on investments in infrastructure, basic social services, and support for income-generating projects. There is clear evidence of productive assets provision: INDH finances projects geared toward job creation and income generation, with local groups, cooperatives, and associations as executing agencies, often involving co-financing for these activities[3][4]. However, there is no explicit mention of regular or one-time cash transfers or stipends directed at the ultra-poor, and neither World Bank documentation nor academic studies cite a direct cash component; most program support appears in the form of funding in-kind infrastructure, social services, or productive assets. Therefore, INDH is multi-component but does not fit the graduation program model and cash transfer evidence is unclear. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Human_Development_Initiative, https://moroccotimes.tv/indh-celebrates-18th-launch-anniversary/, https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/morocco-the-bases-for-a-new-development-model-i-the-national-initiative-for-human-development-indh/",
