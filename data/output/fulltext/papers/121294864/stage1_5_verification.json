  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Agricultural Extension Services Program' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Agricultural Extension Services Program in Ethiopia focuses primarily on providing technical advice, training, inputs, and capacity-building to farmers, rather than direct social protection or poverty graduation[5][7][8]. Agricultural extension is a public sector service aiming to improve agricultural productivity and promote rural development. It is not structured as a graduation model: there is no evidence it operates as an integrated multi-component program targeting the ultra-poor with carefully sequenced interventions, cash transfers/stipends, or direct provision of productive assets—the core features of graduation programs as defined in sources on Ethiopia’s graduation approaches and Food Security Programmes[1][2][4][6]. Some graduation and poverty alleviation programs in Ethiopia do include extension support as one service among several (such as HABP or OFSP, which combine cash, assets, and training), but the standalone Extension Services Program does not provide cash or assets directly—it provides advice, knowledge, and technical support[5][8]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://raise-fs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/customized-extension-to-ensure-inclusiveness_17_12_2020.pdf, https://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/eth205099.pdf, https://saa-safe.org/www/ethiopia.html",
