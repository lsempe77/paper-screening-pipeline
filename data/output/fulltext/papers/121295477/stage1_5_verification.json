Graduation programs typically have time-limited, multi-component interventions including direct cash transfers and productive asset packages to help ultra-poor households build sustainable livelihoods. Compassion's model emphasizes holistic child development, including educational scholarships, vocational training, and psychosocial support, but does not systematically provide ongoing direct cash transfers/stipends to children or families. Instead, sponsorship funds are pooled and disbursed to partner centers, not handed directly to beneficiaries.[7][8] Regarding productive assets, individual cases (such as providing laptops for vocational training[2]) do occur, but there is no evidence that provision of productive assets is a standard program feature. In some cases, special interventions or scholarships are given (i.e., tuition payments, tools for vocational graduates[2]), but this is not comparable to the productive asset packages typical of graduation programs. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.compassion.com/sponsor_a_child/what-is-child-sponsorship/, https://www.compassion.com/for-sponsors/stories/the-graduate-most-likely-to.htm, https://www.compassion.com/for-sponsors/stories/what-happens-to-my-sponsored-child-after-they-graduate.htm",
