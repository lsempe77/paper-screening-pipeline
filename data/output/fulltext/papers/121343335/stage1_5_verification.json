  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'China Clean Air Action (CCAA)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The China Clean Air Action (CCAA) refers to China's national policy and regulatory interventions to reduce air pollution through stricter emission controls, improved environmental standards, and enhanced monitoring systems. All available sources describe CCAA as a set of legislative and administrative actions focused on environmental outcomes, particularly air quality, rather than a social protection or poverty alleviation program. There is no evidence that CCAA targets ultra-poor or extreme poverty groups with a multi-component graduation approach (which typically involves coaching, cash transfers, productive assets, and livelihood support)[2][4][6][7]. None of the sources indicate any provision of direct cash transfers or productive assets to individuals; CCAA interventions primarily affect environmental regulation and city planning, not individual household livelihoods. The only financing mentioned involves institutional investments for pollution control (e.g., loans for clean energy or enterprise upgrades)[1], not household-level transfers or asset distribution. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8881012/, https://cleanairasia.org/sites/default/files/2025-06/China's%2010-Year%20Path%20Toward%20Clean%20Air%20An%20Asian%20Perspective_2024_EN.pdf, https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2020/06/21/china-fighting-air-pollution-and-climate-change-through-clean-energy-financing",
