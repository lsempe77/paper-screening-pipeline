As long-term PM 2.5 exposure declined, there was a significant reduction in multidimensional poverty, with notable improvements across its sub-dimensions, including health status, living standard, social participation, and income level. | Our mediation analysis further revealed that RD and PEF collectively mediated the overall effect of PM 2.5 exposure on the MPI.
