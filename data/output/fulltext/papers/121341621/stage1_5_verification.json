Internet search found graduation programs in Burkina Faso: Perplexity search result: Evidence from Trickle Up, in collaboration with a World Bank-funded government cash transfer project in Burkina Faso, confirms the implementation of a Graduation Approach for extremely poor households. This model targets cash transfer recipients and explicitly integrates 'Graduation' components, which international literature consistently defines as including cash (consumption support) and productive asset transfers (either cash or in-kind), along with training and coaching. Trickle Up's program is described as a large-scale evaluation, testing cost-effective delivery mechanisms of Graduation for 10,000 cash transfer recipient households. The standard 'Graduation' model specifically combines cash transfers and asset transfers, and the partners (Trickle Up and World Bank) are named as implementing this approach. Supporting sources clarify that in Burkina Faso, the Graduation approach for the ultra-poor involves at least cash and asset components. International Graduation literature reviewed in the context of Burkina Faso also confirms that such programs nearly universally include both components. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://trickleup.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/OurWorkBurkinaFaso_2016_10.pdf, https://poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/2024-09/Designing-Cash-Transfer-and-Graduation-Programs-Evidence-Synthesis.pdf, https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/social-protection/global-issues-and-debates-2/graduation-and-cash-plus/",
