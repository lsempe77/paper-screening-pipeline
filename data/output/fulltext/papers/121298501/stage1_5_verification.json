  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Broadband China (BC) pilot policy' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: The Broadband China (BC) pilot policy is a national policy introduced in 2013 to accelerate the development of internet infrastructure across China. Multiple sources confirm that BC focuses on expanding broadband coverage and digitizing enterprises and urban areas, aiming at economic modernization and technological advancement, not poverty reduction or targeted support for ultra-poor populations. There is no evidence from research literature or official communications that the BC pilot is structured as a graduation or multi-component poverty program (such as those evaluated by J-PAL, IPA, World Bank, or modeled after BRAC). There are no reports of unconditional or conditional cash transfers, nor is there a component providing productive assets to individuals. Evaluations of BC focus on its impact on digital infrastructure, green development, enterprise digitization, and mental health but do not mention direct financial or asset-based interventions to households. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/boer.12495?af=R, https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0269133, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04875-z",
