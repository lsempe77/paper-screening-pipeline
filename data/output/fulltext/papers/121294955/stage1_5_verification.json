Its primary intervention is a regular cash stipend (e.g., 55-70 Kwacha/month per household)[2][4][1][3][5][6]. While its goal is to reduce extreme poverty and its design aims to improve food security, nutrition, and child schooling, there is no evidence from official evaluations or research literature that the CGP systematically includes components such as productive assets, skills training, or livelihood support that are hallmarks of graduation or multi-component poverty programs[4][3][7]. Impact assessments specifically note that CGP is primarily cash-based and, despite some positive effects on asset accumulation (like livestock), this resulted from cash use rather than a direct asset transfer or livelihood scheme. Researchers conclude that “cash alone is unlikely to lead to wholesale graduation out of poverty” and CGP households do not sustain gains after program exit, further confirming it is not structured as a graduation program[3][5]. No records indicate that CGP provides productive assets directly. The Government of Zambia has separately piloted 'Cash-Plus' and 'graduation' models in other contexts, which include asset and skill interventions, but these are distinct from the CGP[7]. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/zambia/, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6711746/, https://www.3ieimpact.org/sites/default/files/2019-08/GFR-DPW1.1042-Zambia-UCT.pdf",
