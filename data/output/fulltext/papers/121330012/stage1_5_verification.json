Internet search found graduation programs in Pakistan: Perplexity search result: The National Poverty Graduation Programme (NPGP) in Pakistan is classified as a graduation program. Its objective is to move the ultra-poor and very poor out of poverty through a combination of sustainable livelihood supports. Core components include productive asset transfers (e.g., livestock, small shops), training for asset management and livelihoods, interest-free loans, and cash transfers for consumption support. The program combines multiple interventions typical of the graduation approach originally developed by BRAC and promoted internationally by J-PAL and others. According to official and evaluation sources, beneficiaries receive both one-time productive assets and monthly cash transfers, fulfilling both criteria. Various government documents and third-party studies confirm these modalities and the graduation framing. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://npgp.gov.pk/overview.html, https://www.pass.gov.pk/Detail/NjZhOTk4NjEtZDUzMC00ZjVmLTg3ZGMtMzA3ODBlZmQ5Nzgz, https://poverty-action.org/ultra-poor-graduation-approach",
