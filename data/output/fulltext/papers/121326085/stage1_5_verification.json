Search did not find relevant graduation programs in Malawi: Perplexity search result: The Social Cash Transfer Programme (SCTP) in Malawi is an unconditional cash transfer program targeted at ultra-poor and labor-constrained households. Multiple authoritative sources, including government reports and peer-reviewed articles, describe SCTP as providing regular, unconditional cash payments to beneficiaries, with the primary objectives of reducing poverty, hunger, and improving health and education outcomes[3][4]. There is substantial evidence that SCTP is not, by itself, a graduation program, nor does it provide productive assets. However, SCTP beneficiaries have been targeted under separate graduation initiatives—such as the Ultra-Poor Graduation (UPG) program within the FARMSE project—which combine cash with asset transfers and training[2][6]. But SCTP itself remains a cash-only transfer program, and does not include productive asset provision or the other multi-faceted supports that define graduation programming. | Graduation: NO, Cash: YES, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Malawi-SCTP-Baseline-Report-Final-Dec-2022.pdf, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8757493/, https://nomadit.co.uk/conference/hdca2024/paper/87682",
