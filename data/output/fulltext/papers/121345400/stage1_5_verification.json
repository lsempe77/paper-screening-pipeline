It is not designed as a graduation or multi-component poverty alleviation program like those that integrate cash transfers, asset provision, and skills training for ultra-poor households. GAIP's main products are indexed and area yield-based crop insurance, aiming to promote resilience but not directly providing cash stipends to beneficiaries except as indemnity payouts after insured losses (not unconditional transfers). There is no evidence of GAIP distributing productive assets such as livestock, equipment, or grants. The program’s structure and focus are solely on insurance provision and risk transfer, not on multi-modal livelihood graduation, productive inclusion, or asset-building for the extreme poor. Leading poverty graduation programs (like those inspired by BRAC or evaluated by J-PAL/IPA) explicitly combine cash, assets, and training as core features, which GAIP does not. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.indexinsuranceforum.org/sites/default/files/AgriculturalInsuranceMarketStudy_ACRI.pdf, https://farm-d.org/organization/ghana-agricultural-insurance-programme/, https://gaip.com.gh",
