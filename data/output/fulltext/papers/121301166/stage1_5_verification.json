  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Verified] Paper mentions 'Urban Productive Safety Net Program (UPSNP)'. Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: Multiple sources identify the UPSNP as a multi-component urban poverty program in Ethiopia. Its objectives include improving food security, income, employment, and self-employment for urban poor, ultra-poor, and vulnerable groups[1][2][4][5]. The program provides cash transfers and predictable support to beneficiaries through food, cash, or vouchers[2][5]. Regarding productive assets, although most literature focuses on the rural PSNP, official program descriptions for UPSNP (and its extension, UPSNJP) explicitly list business capital, financial services facilitation, apprenticeship support, and market links as program components, which indicate the provision of assets and capital to support livelihoods and self-employment[1]. Graduation is a core concept in PSNP and its urban adaptation, with formal graduation criteria and asset-based graduation strategies referenced in implementation manuals and impact studies[3][6]. Overall, the UPSNP is a graduation-oriented, multifaceted social protection program with cash and productive asset support. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.peiglobal.org/node/1392, https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/impact-urban-productive-safety-net-programme-poverty-reduction-food-security-evidence_en, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10844108/",
