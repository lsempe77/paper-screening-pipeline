  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Carbon Sink Afforestation Project (CSAP)' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Based on available sources, the Carbon Sink Afforestation Project (CSAP) in China is recognized primarily as an environmental and climate mitigation effort focused on large-scale afforestation, forest restoration, and carbon sequestration[1][3][4]. Its main components include sustainable forest management, ecological restoration, and innovative financing models tied to natural capital. There is no evidence that suggests this project is structured as a graduation or multi-component poverty alleviation program. Graduation programs specifically aim to help ultra-poor households transition out of extreme poverty, typically using cash transfers, productive asset giveaways, training, and coaching. None of the sources mention direct cash transfers or productive asset provision to individuals or households; rather, the focus is on ecosystem restoration and environmental management at the landscape scale. While there may be indirect economic and social benefits from employment or local ecosystem services, there are no indications of targeted cash or asset interventions typical of poverty-focused graduation models. | Graduation: NO, Cash: NO, Assets: NO | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.paulsoninstitute.org/events/2021-winner-nature-stewardship-the-forest-eco-bank-and-carbon-sink-project-nanping-fujian/, https://futureearth.org/2025/04/04/decades-of-ecosystem-restoration-enhance-chinas-land-co2-sinks/, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52785-6",
