  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'Bridges to the Future' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: Based on available evidence, the 'Bridges to the Future' program in Uganda, as referenced by ICHAD, is an innovative family-based economic empowerment intervention primarily aimed at orphans made vulnerable by AIDS, but there is no evidence that it is a graduation or multi-component poverty program in the sense of the graduation approach described by BRAC or AVSI. The graduation approach typically involves a sequenced package of social protection (often cash transfers), asset transfers, training, and coaching aimed at building sustainable livelihoods for the ultra-poor. The ICHAD Bridges to the Future program appears to focus on economic empowerment and potentially includes savings or education, but there is no direct mention of cash transfers or productive asset provision as part of an integrated graduation package. No official sources link this program by name to the graduation model or confirm specific intervention components such as cash or asset transfers. | Graduation: NO, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: MEDIUM | Sources: https://ichad.wustl.edu/bridges-to-the-future/",
