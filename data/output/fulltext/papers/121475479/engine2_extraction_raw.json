Participants are also more likely to be correctly informed about laws. Both households are likely to be more socially accepted than they were previously. | As far as income and food shortages are concerned, participants are now better off with larger incomes and fewer food shortages.

In 2005, their average incomes increased to Tk. 4,415 and Tk. 3,597 respectively, the gap now a positive Tk. 818. The negative gap changing to positive shows that though the SUP had lower income in 2002, their income is higher than NSUP's income in 2005.
