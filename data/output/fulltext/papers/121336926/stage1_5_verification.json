Internet search confirms this is a graduation program: Perplexity search result: BRAC's CFPR-TUP in Bangladesh is widely recognized as the originator and model for the 'graduation approach' to ultra-poverty, designed specifically to help extremely poor individuals and households 'graduate' out of poverty through a multi-component package. Core components include: (1) Regular cash stipends or consumption support to address immediate needs[2][3], (2) Transfer of productive assets such as livestock or equipment to kick-start sustainable livelihoods[2][3][6], (3) Training and mentoring to build capacity and confidence, (4) Access to healthcare, social support, and integration services. Multiple authoritative sources, including BRAC documentation, CGAP, academic RCTs, and the VoxDev summary confirm the use of both cash transfers and asset provision as central features, and that CFPR-TUP is a graduation program. | Graduation: YES, Cash: YES, Assets: YES | Confidence: HIGH | Sources: https://www.bracusa.org/solutions/development/poverty/ultra-poor-graduation/, https://refugees.trickleup.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2015_BRAC_PROPEL_Toolkit_compressed.pdf, https://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/2.1.Pahlowan2014-CFPR-TUPProgramBRACpptv229-apr-14.pdf",
