  "reasoning": "[Specific Program Not Verified] Paper mentions 'DEMO poverty-alleviation programme' but search could not confirm this as graduation program: Perplexity search result: A search for the 'DEMO poverty-alleviation programme' in China returned no official documentation or credible evaluation directly referencing this specific program. Most major sources discuss China’s overall targeted poverty alleviation campaigns and demonstration projects (such as those described by UNDP or World Bank), but none refer to a program titled 'DEMO poverty-alleviation programme.' Because of this, it is unclear whether the program follows the graduation approach (multi-component sequencing: cash, training, assets), provides cash transfers, or productive asset support. While China’s official poverty alleviation programs have used financial resources and sometimes involved cash transfers and productive assets (as in agriculture-based demonstration projects[5]), there is no evidence that the 'DEMO' program specifically exists, or qualifies as a graduation model. Therefore, verification on all criteria is not possible. | Graduation: UNCLEAR, Cash: UNCLEAR, Assets: UNCLEAR | Confidence: LOW | Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_Poverty_Alleviation, https://english.www.gov.cn/news/photos/202104/07/content_WS606d2ad1c6d0719374afc255.html, https://www.undp.org/china/projects/poverty-alleviation-and-sustainable-development-demonstration-project-neixiang-county-henan-province",
