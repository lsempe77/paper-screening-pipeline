# Structured Graduation Programs Screening Prompt

You are an expert researcher conducting a systematic review on graduation programs. Your task is to systematically evaluate each inclusion criterion for the following paper and make a final screening decision.

## PAPER DETAILS:
- **Title:** {title}
- **Authors:** {authors}
- **Journal:** {journal}
- **Year:** {year}
- **Publication Type:** {publication_type}
- **Keywords:** {keywords}
- **DOI:** {doi}

## ABSTRACT:
{abstract}

## SCREENING EVALUATION:

Please evaluate each criterion individually and provide a clear YES/NO/UNCLEAR answer with brief reasoning.

### 1. PARTICIPANTS CRITERION:
**Question:** Does the study focus on individuals or households in Low & Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)?
**Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Reasoning:** [Brief explanation]

### 2. DUAL-COMPONENT INTERVENTION CRITERION:
**Question:** Does the program include BOTH of the following components?
- Component A: Provision of cash or in-kind support to cover basic needs
- Component B: Provision of a productive asset to support income-generating activity

**Component A Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Component A Evidence:** [Brief explanation]

**Component B Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR] 
**Component B Evidence:** [Brief explanation]

**Overall Dual-Component Assessment:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]

### 3. OUTCOMES CRITERION:
**Question:** Does the study measure relevant outcomes (assets, expenditure, income, savings, poverty, work/employment, health)?
**Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Reasoning:** [Brief explanation]

### 4. STUDY DESIGN CRITERION:
**Question:** Does the study use appropriate research methods (experimental, quasi-experimental, qualitative, mixed-methods, process evaluation, or cost analysis)?
**Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Reasoning:** [Brief explanation]

### 5. TEMPORAL CRITERION:
**Question:** Was the study published in 2004 or later?
**Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Reasoning:** [Brief explanation]

### 6. COMPLETION CRITERION:
**Question:** Is this a completed study (not ongoing or incomplete)?
**Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Reasoning:** [Brief explanation]

## FINAL DECISION LOGIC (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):
**CRITICAL RULE: These are strict, non-negotiable rules:**

1. **EXCLUDE**: If ANY criterion is assessed as "NO" → AUTOMATIC EXCLUDE
   - Even 1 NO criterion = EXCLUDE (no exceptions)
   - Do not consider other factors if any criterion is NO

2. **INCLUDE**: If ALL criteria are assessed as "YES" → INCLUDE
   - All 8 criteria must be YES

3. **MAYBE**: If NO criteria are "NO" AND one or more criteria are "UNCLEAR" → MAYBE
   - Only use MAYBE when no definitive exclusion criteria are met
   - MAYBE is for borderline cases needing human review

**DO NOT deviate from these rules under any circumstances.**

**Key Instructions:**
- Be EXTREMELY conservative: if information is not explicitly and clearly stated, mark as UNCLEAR rather than inferring or assuming
- IMPORTANT: Do not use quotation marks in your reasoning text to avoid JSON parsing errors
- CRITICAL: Provide SPECIFIC, UNIQUE justifications for each criterion:
  - Each reasoning must cite SPECIFIC text or evidence from the paper
  - Do NOT reuse the same reasoning for multiple criteria
  - Do NOT use generic statements like "appropriate study design" without specifics
  - Quote or reference the exact words/phrases from the abstract that support your assessment
  - If no specific evidence exists, explain what information is missing
- For Component A (Cash/In-kind Support): ONLY mark YES if there is EXPLICIT mention of:
  - Cash transfers, cash grants, or cash payments
  - Consumption support or food assistance
  - Stipends or allowances for basic needs
  - Specific in-kind support (food, vouchers) for covering basic consumption
- For Component B (Productive Assets): ONLY mark YES if there is EXPLICIT mention of:
  - Asset transfers (livestock given to participants)
  - Equipment or tools provided 
  - Business capital or start-up grants
  - Physical productive resources transferred to participants
- CRITICAL: Generic terms are INSUFFICIENT evidence:
  - "inputs" alone is NOT sufficient (could be cash OR assets OR both)
  - "support" alone is NOT sufficient
  - "assistance" alone is NOT sufficient
  - "program provides X to create livelihoods" is NOT sufficient unless X explicitly describes both components
- If you cannot clearly identify BOTH components as separate, distinct elements, mark dual_component_overall as UNCLEAR
- The program must have BOTH components EXPLICITLY and SEPARATELY described to qualify
- MAYBE category is for cases where key information is unclear but not definitively absent
