## INCLUSION CRITERIA EVALUATION

For EACH criterion below, assess as YES/NO/UNCLEAR and provide specific reasoning:

### 1. PARTICIPANTS FROM LMIC:
**Question:** Does the study focus on participants from low or middle-income countries?
**Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Reasoning:** [State specific country/region and confirm LMIC status]

### 2. COMPONENT A - CASH/IN-KIND SUPPORT:
**Question:** Does the program include cash transfers, consumption support, or stipends?
**Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Reasoning:** [Quote specific text about cash/consumption support or state what is missing]

**Examples of YES:**
- "monthly cash transfers"
- "unconditional cash transfers" 
- "consumption support"
- "food stipends"
- "cash grants"
- "direct cash assistance"

### 3. COMPONENT B - PRODUCTIVE ASSETS:
**Question:** Does the program include productive asset transfers (livestock, equipment, etc.)?
**Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Reasoning:** [Quote specific text about asset transfers or state what is missing]

**Examples of YES:**
- "livestock transfers"
- "productive asset transfers"
- "equipment provision"
- "agricultural inputs"
- "business equipment"
- "tools and machinery"

### 4. RELEVANT OUTCOMES:
**Question:** Does the study measure economic/livelihood outcomes (income, assets, expenditure, poverty)?
**Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Reasoning:** [List specific outcomes measured or state what is missing]

**Examples of YES:**
- Income, earnings, wages
- Assets, wealth
- Expenditure, consumption
- Poverty rates, poverty status
- Business profits, revenues
- Food security, nutrition

### 5. APPROPRIATE STUDY DESIGN:
**Question:** Does the study use quantitative impact evaluation methods (RCT, quasi-experimental)?
**Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Reasoning:** [Specify research method mentioned or state what design info is missing]

**Examples of YES:**
- "randomized controlled trial" (RCT)
- "randomized experiment" 
- "difference-in-differences"
- "instrumental variables"
- "regression discontinuity"
- "propensity score matching"
- "natural experiment"

**Examples of NO:**
- Qualitative studies only
- Descriptive studies
- Case studies without comparison groups
- Literature reviews

### 6. PUBLICATION YEAR 2004+:
**Question:** Was the study published in 2004 or later?
**Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Reasoning:** [State exact publication year and confirm if >= 2004]

### 7. COMPLETED STUDY:
**Question:** Is this a completed study (not ongoing or incomplete)?
**Evaluation:** [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
**Reasoning:** [Explain evidence of completion status or what is missing]

## EVIDENCE STANDARDS & EXAMPLES

**For YES Assessment:**
- Clear, explicit mention of the criterion in the abstract
- Reasonable inference from strong contextual evidence
- Standard terminology that clearly indicates the criterion is met

**For NO Assessment:**
- Explicit statement that criterion is not met
- Clear evidence the study focuses on something else entirely
- Definitive information contradicting the criterion

**For UNCLEAR Assessment:**
- Insufficient information to make a confident determination
- Ambiguous wording that could go either way
- Missing key details needed for assessment

## FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES

**Example 1 - CLEAR INCLUDE:**
Abstract: "We evaluate a graduation program in Bangladesh providing monthly cash stipends and productive asset transfers (livestock, equipment) to ultra-poor households. Using randomized controlled trial methodology, we measure impacts on income, assets, and expenditure over 24 months. Results show significant improvements in economic outcomes."

Assessment:
- LMIC: YES (Bangladesh is LMIC)
- Cash support: YES ('monthly cash stipends')
- Productive assets: YES ('livestock, equipment')
- Outcomes: YES ('income, assets, expenditure')
- Study design: YES ('randomized controlled trial')
- Year 2004+: YES (recent study)
- Completed: YES ('Results show' indicates completion)

**Example 2 - CLEAR EXCLUDE:**
Abstract: "This qualitative study explores experiences of microfinance borrowers in rural India through in-depth interviews. We examine how access to small loans affects women's empowerment and social status in traditional communities."

Assessment:
- LMIC: YES (India is LMIC)
- Cash support: NO (only loans, not cash transfers/stipends)
- Productive assets: NO (no mention of asset transfers)
- Outcomes: UNCLEAR (empowerment mentioned but economic outcomes unclear)
- Study design: NO (qualitative study, not impact evaluation)
- Year 2004+: UNCLEAR (no publication year mentioned)
- Completed: YES (past tense indicates completion)
Decision: EXCLUDE (multiple NO criteria)

**Example 3 - LEGITIMATE MAYBE:**
Abstract: "We study a social protection program in Kenya providing support to vulnerable households. The intervention includes various forms of assistance aimed at improving livelihoods. Preliminary analysis suggests positive effects on household welfare measured through survey data."

Assessment:
- LMIC: YES (Kenya is LMIC)
- Cash support: UNCLEAR ('various forms of assistance' - unclear if includes cash)
- Productive assets: UNCLEAR ('various forms of assistance' - unclear if includes assets)
- Outcomes: UNCLEAR ('household welfare' - unclear if includes economic measures)
- Study design: UNCLEAR (methodology not specified)
- Year 2004+: UNCLEAR (no publication year)
- Completed: UNCLEAR ('preliminary analysis' suggests ongoing)
Decision: MAYBE (many UNCLEAR, no definitive exclusions)

## FINAL DECISION LOGIC (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):

**STEP 1: COUNT YOUR ASSESSMENTS**
- Count how many criteria you marked as YES
- Count how many criteria you marked as NO  
- Count how many criteria you marked as UNCLEAR
- Total should equal 7

**STEP 2: APPLY DECISION RULES (MANDATORY)**

1. **IF ANY CRITERION IS "NO" → DECISION MUST BE "EXCLUDE"**
   - Check: Do you have any NO assessments?
   - If YES: Your decision MUST be EXCLUDE
   - No exceptions, no overrides, no considerations
   - Example: 6Y/1N/0U = EXCLUDE (because 1 NO exists)

2. **IF ALL 7 CRITERIA ARE "YES" → DECISION MUST BE "INCLUDE"**
   - Check: Do you have exactly 7 YES and 0 NO and 0 UNCLEAR?
   - If YES: Your decision MUST be INCLUDE
   - Example: 7Y/0N/0U = INCLUDE

3. **IF NO CRITERIA ARE "NO" AND SOME ARE "UNCLEAR" → DECISION MUST BE "MAYBE"**
   - Check: Do you have 0 NO and some UNCLEAR?
   - If YES: Your decision MUST be MAYBE
   - Example: 5Y/0N/2U = MAYBE

**STEP 3: VERIFY YOUR LOGIC**
- If you have any NO: You CANNOT choose INCLUDE or MAYBE
- If you have 7 YES: You CANNOT choose EXCLUDE or MAYBE
- If you have 0 NO but some UNCLEAR: You CANNOT choose INCLUDE or EXCLUDE

**Key Instructions:**
- Be systematic but not overly conservative
- Use reasonable inference when evidence is strong
- Reserve UNCLEAR for genuinely ambiguous cases
- Ensure valid JSON formatting with straight quotes
- When quoting text within reasoning, use single quotes
