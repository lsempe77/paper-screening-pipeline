# Graduation Programs Systematic Review Screening Prompt

You are an expert researcher conducting a systematic review on graduation programs that aim to help participants graduate from (extreme) poverty. Your task is to screen the following academic paper to determine if it should be **INCLUDED** or **EXCLUDED** based on the specific screening criteria below.

## PAPER DETAILS:
- **Title:** {title}
- **Authors:** {authors}
- **Journal:** {journal}
- **Year:** {year}
- **Publication Type:** {publication_type}
- **Keywords:** {keywords}
- **DOI:** {doi}

## ABSTRACT:
{abstract}

## SCREENING CRITERIA:

### INCLUSION CRITERIA:

**PARTICIPANTS:**
- Studies must focus on individuals or households in Low & Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)

**INTERVENTIONS:**
- Programs that aim to graduate participants from (extreme) poverty AND consist of at least TWO components:
  1. Provision of cash or in-kind support to cover basic needs
  2. Provision of a productive asset to support an income-generating activity
- Programs providing additional components (training, financial inclusion, etc.) are INCLUDED
- Programs providing only ONE of these components (e.g., unconditional cash transfers alone) are EXCLUDED

**COMPARATOR:**
- No intervention (service delivery as usual), OR
- Pipeline/wait-list control (service delivery as usual), OR  
- Other intervention

**OUTCOMES:**
- **Primary outcomes:** indicators related to assets, expenditure, income, savings, and poverty
- **Secondary outcomes:** indicators related to work/employment and health
- **Other outcomes:** social participation, empowerment (will be mapped but not analyzed)

**STUDY DESIGNS:**
- **Research question 1:** Impact evaluations based on experimental or quasi-experimental designs
- **Research question 2:** Studies of graduation programs with clear research questions addressing program design, implementation, context and/or consequences, based on qualitative designs, descriptive quantitative designs, mixed-methods designs, and process evaluations
- **Research question 3:** Studies or reports including unit or total program costs for implementers, participants or non-participants

**ADDITIONAL CRITERIA:**
- Year of publication: 2004 onwards
- Language: Any language (but search terms developed in English)
- Publication status: Completed studies from academic and grey literature sources

### EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
- Studies NOT focused on LMICs
- Programs with only ONE component (cash/in-kind support OR productive asset, but not both)
- Studies published before 2004
- Incomplete or ongoing studies
- Studies without relevant outcomes (assets, expenditure, income, savings, poverty, work/employment, health)

## INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Carefully read the paper details, especially the title and abstract
2. Evaluate against EACH inclusion criterion, paying special attention to:
   - Whether it's a graduation program with BOTH required components
   - Whether it focuses on LMICs
   - Whether it measures relevant outcomes
   - Whether it uses appropriate study designs
3. Make a decision: **INCLUDE** or **EXCLUDE**
4. Give detailed reasoning referencing specific criteria

## RESPONSE FORMAT:
Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format:

```json
{{
    "decision": "INCLUDE" or "EXCLUDE",
    "reasoning": "Detailed explanation referencing specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and evidence from the paper. Focus on whether the program has both required components (cash/in-kind support AND productive assets) and other key criteria."
}}
```

**Important:** Pay special attention to whether the intervention includes BOTH components required for graduation programs. Programs with only cash transfers or only asset transfers should be EXCLUDED.
